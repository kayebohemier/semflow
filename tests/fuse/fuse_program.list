A001|1| |KLAUS|WERNER|Institut fur Astronomie und Astrophysik, Universitat Tubinge|We propose to study the two prototypes of a new class of hot white dwarfs (WD).  The optical spectra reveal absorption lines from ultra-high ionized metals (e.g.\ O\,VIII), a phenomenon never observed before in any astronomical object.  The occurrence of such features requires temperatures in the order of 10$^6$\,K, far in excess of the stellar T$_{\rm eff}$.  The asymmetric profile shapes suggest formation in a rapidly accelerating high-speed wind (10\,000~km/s).  These stars represent the most convincing proof for on-going mass-loss from WDs.  We have demonstrated that a large fraction of hot WDs shows this phenomenon, concluding that perhaps {\it all} WD go through this evolutionary stage.  We will study the wind properties and possible consequences for WD evolution on hand of detailed NLTE modelling.  Recently obtained medium-resolution UV (HST) and FUV (ORFEUS) spectra pose new problems.  In particular, the FUV region contains many inter-/circumstellar features which contaminate the photospheric spectrum.  Hence we ask for high-resolution high-S/N FUV spectra for a deeper insight into this mysterious phenomenon.
A002|1| |FRANCOISE|COMBES| |The cold molecular hydrogen gas (below 10\,K) does not radiate, and it is an open question to know in which quantity it is present in galaxies and in particular in the Milky Way.  Within the optical disk, the metallicity is significant enough that the cold H$_2$ is traced by molecules such as CO (with large uncertainties however, in particular for very cold H$_2$).  But at the border of the optical disk (basically at the solar radius) and beyond, the amount of H$_2$ is unknown.  We have recently developped the case for the presence of large masses of cold molecular hydrogen in the outer disks of spiral galaxies and in dwarf irregulars.  The bulk of the H$_2$ gas would be located in small clumpuscules, the smallest fragments of the hierarchical fractal structure of the gaseous interstellar medium.  Because they are cold, only absorption in front of external sources can reveal them.  Since we want to sample the outer disk, suitable sources are not stars, but remote QSO's almost in the plane of the disk ($b < 10^\circ$).  In regions with no or very little dust, it is possible to probe larger column densities than for normal clouds, up to the limit where the H$_2$ itself absorbs most of the UV-light of the QSO.  In the solar neighbourhood, we can also probe high-latitude molecular clouds, in front of high-latitude QSO's.  Since at this radius, there exists still some CO tracer, these observations will determine the conversion ratio H$_2$/CO, which remains an open problem for high-latitude clouds.
A003|1| |JOHN|HUTCHINGS|Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, HIA, NRC of Canada, Cana|We propose to obtain phase-resolved $FUSE$ spectra of three supersoft X-ray binaries, achieving S/N of $\sim$20 over 0.5--1.0\AA\ in orbital phase bins of $\leq$0.1P.  The emission line features in the $FUSE$ wavelength range cover a wide range of ionization giving a unique dataset for determination of the binary parameters, component masses, and disk structures which cannot be provided by optical and $HST$ data.  We will also use the combined data for each system to detect and measure high-velocity lines from bi-polar jets which are seen in the optical spectra of all three systems.  High-ionization lines from these jets are of particular interest since they are formed in the innermost region where the jets are undergoing their collimation and acceleration.  An improved understanding of jets has wide astrophysical implications.
A004|1| |HANS MARTIN|SCHMID|Landessternwarte Heidelberg, Germany|We propose FUSE observations of the O~VI 1032, 1038 emission line structures in symbiotic systems in order to compare them with spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations of the Raman scattered counterparts in the red spectral region.  From this we can derive the Doppler shift and polarization induced in the H$^0$ Raman scattering process.  This allows to deduce information on the geometric and dynamic structure of the red giant's wind region in these interacting binary systems.  In particular, our analysis should clarify the geometry of the ionization front between the cool giant and the hot component, which depends in a very sensitive way on hydrodynamical and radiative interaction processes.
A010|1| |LILIA|FERRARIO|Astrophysical Theory Centre, Australian National University,|We have recently identified the dominant features in the optical spectra of the rapidly rotating (725\fs5) magnetic white dwarf EUVE~~J0317--855 with $H{\alpha}$ 2s0 - 3p-1, 2s0 - 3p0 and $H{\beta}$ 2s0 - 4f-1 in a magnetic field of 100-300 MG, but some features remain unidentified.  IUE data show Ly$\alpha$ ${\sigma^+}$ at 1300\AA, and an unidentified feature near 1330 \AA.  Models using centred and off-centred dipole field structures provide a reasonable fit to the averaged spectra for a dipole strength of $B_d=450$ MG displaced from the centre of the star by 35\% $R_*$ and viewed at a mean angle of $30 -60\gradi$ to the dipole axis.  The nature of the observed spectral variations and of the unidentified lines remains unknown.  We propose to carry out phase-dependent FUSE observations of the Lyman line series in order to resolve the field structure responsible for the observed photometric and spectroscopic variations.  Based on a single TTAG data set we will reconstruct five seperate high-SN spectra, each at a specific rotational phase.
A013|1| |STEFAN|DREIZLER|Institut fur Astronomie und Astrophysik, Universitat Tubinge|We propose to observe three helium-rich (DO) white dwarfs in order to determine their photospheric abundances of trace elements (e.g.  C, N, O, H, Fe, Ni,...).  FUSE spectroscopy is ideal for this purpose since the FUV allows to explore a large variety of line transitions of various elements which are not detectable in existing optical or UV spectra of the targets.  The data will be analyzed with non-LTE metal line blanketed model atmospheres.  The results will be compared to predictions from newly developed, self-consistent diffusion/radiative levitation calculations under non-LTE conditions.  The observed metal abundances will serve as bench-marks for such kind of new calculations.  As a basis for this work we have obtained high-S/N optical spectra of almost all known DO white dwarfs within the last five years as well as HST GHRS spectra of selected DO white dwarfs.  A comprehensive analysis of the atmospheric parameters is now available.  For the present proposal we have selected three targets which -- together with calibration and PI targets-- represent the non-DA white dwarf cooling sequence from the hot end down to the DB gap.
A019|1| |RANDY|GLADSTONE|Southwest Research Institute, USA|The origin of Titan's thick nitrogen and methane atmosphere is a compelling enigma.  One key and still missing observable concerns the abundances of noble gases in general, and argon in particular.  Detection of argon would indicate that the N$_2$ and CO now found in the atmosphere probably came in with ice during Titan's accretion.  Alternatively, if there is very little argon, then we have to turn to models starting with frozen ammonia, methane and water ice, indicating a more important role for the Saturn sub-nebula, and requiring subsequent modification by photochemistry.  Current estimates on the fraction of argon in Titan's atmosphere are crude, and based only on indirect evidence, and range from 0--25\%.  We have modeled Titan's expected photoelectron-generated EUV emissions with argon as an added constituent.  The bright resonance line of argon at 1048\ang\ is predicted to be present at a level of 7--12~R, for assumed argon abundances of 5--25\% in the lower atmosphere of Titan.  At a brightness of 7~R, an 80~ks integration time by FUSE would provide a $>\!5\sigma$ detection of argon in the atmosphere of Titan (a 30~ks integration would provide a $>\!3\sigma$ detection).  An accurate determination of the abundance of argon on Titan would be useful in preparing for the arrival of the {\it Cassini} orbiter and {\it Huygens} probe at the Saturn system.
A022|1| |GEORGE|FISHER|Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California-Berkeley|We will obtain high resolution FUSE spectra of the dMe star AD Leo during periods of quiescence and during flares to study the physics of atmospheric heating in flare stars.  We will also obtain coordinated ground based observations including multicolor photometry and high resolution optical spectroscopy.  Light curves obtained during flares will allow us to determine the coronal loop length and flare coverage area on the stellar surface.  The FUSE spectra will also allow us to determine the structure and evolution of temperature and density in the corona, transition region, and chromosphere, allowing us to test detailed models of flare evolution.  The unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of FUSE will strongly constrain current models.  Finally, we will search for significant red-shifted emission in the Lyman series lines of hydrogen during the rise phase of flares, possibly indicating the presence of energetic proton beams.  The existence and role of proton beams in both solar and stellar flares is currently a subject of great debate.
A023|1| |VERONIQUE|BUAT|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale, CNRS, Marseille, France|We propose to observe several bright star-forming galaxies with FUSE.  These galaxies are selected to have been already observed in the near UV, visible and far-infrared.  The analysis of the entire spectral energy distribution longward the Lyman break will allow us to study the star formation history, the initial mass function and the effects of dust extinction in these objects.  These galaxies will constitute needful templates for the study of high redshift actively star-forming galaxies.  Under reasonable assumptions for intrinsically bright galaxies, the UV continuum (912-1200$\AA$) is rather insensitive to the star formation history and the initial mass function.  Any departure from the expected flat spectrum in our sample of intrinsically bright galaxies may be attributed to the effects of internal dust and will be used to deduce an empirical attenuation curve down to the Lyman break.  The analysis of the stellar absorption lines in the far and near UV complemented with the interstellar emission lines in the optical and the overall shape of the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies will give us constraints about the recent star formation history, the initial mass function of the more massive stars and the contribution of an older underlying stellar population.
A024|1| |MARTINE|MOUCHET|Observatoire de Paris-Meudon, France|Magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (MCV) typically show UV emission line intensity ratios broadly compatible with photo-ionization by thermal radiation of ~20-50 eV, arising from accretion onto highly magnetized white dwarfs.  However, four systems display peculiar UV line ratios not compatible with any modelling, suggesting a very peculiar ionization/ excitation process or surprising abnormal abundances which might be signs of a recent nova explosion or reflect the non-solar composition of the companion's atmosphere.  We propose to observe the two Polars, BY Cam (H0538+608) and V1309 Ori (RX J0515.6+0105) which both show a strong deficiency in CIV correlated with a large excess in NV.  The unprecedented sensitivity of FUSE in the 905-1195\AA{} region will allow the measurement of the expected strong OVI doublet as well as several crucial C and N lines, all of which are essential to discriminate between models for the origin of the C, N emission line anomaly.  The program requests a total of {\bf 16} orbits (including 2 orbits for acquisition) and a total on-source exposure time of {\bf 28 ksec} for the two sources to obtain spectra with a spectral resolution of 0.3\AA{} and a S/N ratio above 5 in the continuum allowing a detailed multi-component line profile study over several orbital phases.
A026|1| |ULRICH|HEBER|Astronomisches Institut, Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Germ|LS IV-12.1 and ROB 162 are rare, hot (\Teff=50 -- 60\,000K) subdwarf O stars of population II, evolving from the asymptotic giant branch to the white dwarf domain.  FUSE spectra are proposed to determine the abundances of C,N,Si,P,S and Fe by means of NLTE model atmospheres.  In the case of \ls\, its high radial velocity allows the photospheric resonance lines to be separated from interstellar components.  The results of the abundance analysis will shed light on PAGB evolution in population II stars and will allow physical processes such as dredge-up of nuclearly processed matter and/or gas-dust fractionation in the AGB progenitor stars envelope to be investigated.  The [S/Fe] ratio is a sensitive tracer of the latter process.  The crucial sulphur abundance can most reliably be derived from the \ion{S}{4} and \ion{S}{6} lines in the FUV.
A034|1| |MARTIN|BARSTOW|Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester|We propose FUSE observations of a sample of the hottest known DA white dwarfs to study their evolution and the link between them and their CSPN progenitors.  Analysis of the H Lyman lines provides a unique determination of $T_{eff}$ and log g for each star, taking into account the heavy element abundances, which are known to affect the temperature determination, which we will determine from measurements of line strengths in the high resolution FUSE spectra.  Importantly, FUSE gives us access to absorption lines of several species which cannot be studied in any other wavelength range.  From this work, combined with observations of cooler PI/calibration white dwarf targets, when they appear in the public archive, we will reestablish the hot DA white dwarf temperature scale.  In addition, with significantly improved accuracy in the temperature determination we will be able to track the evolution of stellar photospheric abundance with cooling age for the first time.
A035|1| |JOHN|MULCHAEY|Carnegie Institution of Washington, USA|Recent ROSAT observations indicate that $\sim$ 20\% of nearby groups of galaxies contain a low-density, X-ray emitting intragroup medium.  If present in all groups of galaxies, the intragroup medium would be the dominant baryonic component in the local universe.  However, the ROSAT observations indicate that X-ray emission is almost exclusively restricted to groups that are dominated by elliptical and S0 galaxies.  The much more common spiral-dominated groups, such as the Local Group, are not X-ray detected.  The most likely explanation for the non-X-ray detection of spiral-rich groups is that the intragroup medium in these systems is too cool to produce detectable X-ray emission.  The intragroup medium in spiral-rich groups is expected, however, to produce detectable absorption features in the spectra of background quasars.  We propose to observe with FUSE three AGN situated behind low redshift spiral-rich groups to search for the O VI doublet in absorption, as expected from a warm intragroup medium.  The detection of O VI absorption from these groups would verify that an intragroup medium exists in all groups and is the dominant baryonic component in the local universe.  The S/N of our proposed FUSE observations are such that the failure to detect O VI in absorption would put strict limits on the presence of an intragroup medium in spiral-rich groups.  Furthermore, this limit would suggest that our current estimate for the amount of baryonic material in groups is overestimated by at least a factor of ten.
A036|1| |TRINH XUAN|THUAN|Astronomy Department, University of Virginia, USA|How galaxies form is one of the most fundamental questions in astrophysics.  Much effort has gone into the search for primeval galaxies at high redshifts.  But these galaxies are faint and small, making their study very difficult even with the largest telescopes.  We propose here an alternative approach, the study of nearby blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies that are chemically young.  Our sample consists of 4 BCDs, two of which are among the most metal-deficient galaxies known, and which appear to be truly young, not containing stars older than $\sim$100 Myr, SBS 0335--052 ($Z_\odot$/41) and UGC 4483 ($Z_\odot$/21).  The two other BCDs, MKN 59 ($Z_\odot$/8) and MKN 71 ($Z_\odot$/10), have larger metallicities and ages, and allow us to explore the far-UV properties of BCDs over a wider  ange of sub-solar metallicities.  The proposed FUSE observations will allow us to investigate: 1) the H$_2$ content of BCDs.  This will directly constrain models of galaxy formation as H$_2$ is an important cooling agent in the primordial gas; and 2) the evolutionary history and stellar winds in BCDs by detecting the P Cygni profiles of high ionization lines not observed at longer wavelengths such as S VI and O VI.  The proposed observations will give us the opportunity to explore new spectroscopic techniques in the far-UV that can be later applied to the study of the star formation history in high-redshift primeval star-forming galaxies, where the far-UV is shifted to the near-UV or the optical.
A041|1| |THEODORE|SIMON|Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii, USA|Main sequence A stars have both a small convective core as well as a thinconvective layer just below the visible surface.  While neither of these two regions is directly observable, convection clearly plays a key role in many aspects of A star behavior. One of the most notable of these is the formation of a high temperature chromosphere or corona.  Using FUSE, we propose to observe the far UV spectra of a sample of 8 normal A-type stars, which cover a broad range in $T_{\rm eff}$ and color index.  Our goal is to use the diagnostically important lines of O VI, which form at 300,000 K, and the density-sensitive lines of C III, which form at 60,000 K, to find the locus for the onset of convection zones, coronae, and chromospheres along the main sequence, thereby testing the predictions of stellar structure models as well as  chromospheric/coronal heating models.  Such observations are best made below \lya, where A--star photospheres appear much darker and offer less of a hindrance than at near UV and optical wavelengths
A044|1| |BRAM|BOROSON|High Energy Astrophysics Division, Smithsonian Astrophysical|We propose to observe three High Mass X-ray Binaries with FUSE; one LMC source (LMC X-4), one SMC source (SMC X-1) and one galactic source (Vela X-1).  We will observe the \ion{O}{6}$\lambda\lambda1031,1037$ P~Cygni line variations over the binary orbit.  The orbital variations result from X-ray photoionization of the wind, and allow us to model the wind structure to determine its density and velocity field.  We will look for pulsations in the UV lines and continuum.  Lyman series absorption lines from the primary star will help us model the wind lines, and can measure the rotation and orbit of the primary.  We will also look for ellipsoidal variations in the continuum light curves.
A046|1| |TIMOTHY|HECKMAN|Center for Astrophysical Sciences, Johns Hopkins University,|Starbursts are a significant component of the present-day universe, and offer unique laboratories for both studying the processes that have regulated the formation and evolution of galaxies, and for testing models of high-mass stellar evolution.  We propose to exploit the unique strengths of FUSE to obtain full-resolution ($\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$) high quality (S/N $\geq$ 15) spectra of the six UV-brightest starbursts.  These starbursts span ranges of 20 in metallicity (1/8 to 2.5 solar) and $\sim$ 10$^2$ in luminosity.  The spectra will be used to study: 1) the coronal-phase gas that may dominate the energetics of starburst-driven `superwinds' 2) the H$_2$ that probably dominates the ISM mass and regulates the star-formation 3) the starburst dust-attenuation law in the unexplored FUV window 4) the stellar content of the starburst (thereby probing the IMF and burst history).  These will be the finest UV spectra obtained to-date for starbursts.  In particular, the FUSE MDRS aperture allows us to obtain high-resolution spectra of nearly the entire starburst (rather than small pieces, as with HST and STIS).
A048|1| |PATRICK|HARTIGAN|Dept. of Space Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, USA|We propose to test our understanding of radiative cooling behind shocks by comparing the fluxes of far-UV emission lines in stellar jets with predictions from shock models.  Our targets include the brightest examples of three distinct types of shock waves in these objects -- high-excitation, low-excitation/molecular, and preionized.  Spectra of the high-excitation bow shock HH~1F should have detectable O~VI $\lambda$1035 emission if existing models are accurate.  The lack of such emission would suggest that magnetic fields play an important role in the dynamics of this object.  The unique combination of detectable H$_2$ fluorescent lines and low reddening in the low-excitation object HH~47A will allow us to measure the relative importance of molecular and atomic cooling in low-velocity shocks, and to assess the degree to which pumping by postshock Lyman $\alpha$ and Lyman $\beta$ photons heats the H$_2$.  A FUSE spectrum of the preionized low-excitation bow shock HH~47D will clarify how the ambient UV radiation affects emission line ratios between 900\AA\ and 1200\AA .  
A049|1| |BART|WAKKER|Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, US|One of the stated major scientific goals of the FUSE PI programs is a survey of the amount and distribution of the \OVI\ ion in the Milky Way disk and halo and in the Magellanic Clouds, in order to understand how matter and energy are transferred between the disk and halo.  In particular, the halo program allows to understand how plumes generated by OB associations spread out.  A study of \OVI\ in the halo must avoid sightlines through active regions.  This is the case for about 100 Milky Way sightlines on the reserved-target list, but only for 3 stars selected in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Since we recently used \CIV\ absorption data to show that the LMC indeed has \dex5\,K halo gas, we request time with FUSE to study the global distribution of the \OVI\ absorption in the LMC.  With these data we will asses the relationship between the \dex6\,K X-ray emitting gas, the \dex4\,K \Ha\ maps, and the \dex5\,K gas.
A051|1| |STEVEN|FEDERMAN|Univ. Toledo USA|We propose to study photodissociation regions through observations of absorption from rotational levels in the vibrational ground state of H$_2$.  These transitions occur below 1150 \AA.  Photodissociation regions are found around newly-formed B stars and beyond the H~{\small II} regions surrounding newly-formed O stars because their ultraviolet flux is sufficient to convert molecular species into atoms.  H$_2$ is destroyed by a two step process: absorption into excited electronic states followed by radiative decay into the continuum of the ground electronic state.  This occurs with an efficiency of $\sim$ 10\%; the remaining decays to excited vibrational states then lead to infrared emission that returns the molecule to the vibrational ground state, but with a non-thermal distribution for the populations of high-lying rotational levels.  We will extract the gas temperature from the relative amounts in the lowest rotational levels and the flux of ultraviolet radiation permeating the gas from the amount in excited rotational levels.  The estimates for temperature and flux will lead to refined models of photodissociation regions previously based solely on infrared emission.
A052|1| |JEAN-MICHEL|DEHARVENG|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale CNRS, Marseille, France|The amount of ionizing radiation released into the intergalactic medium by star formation is a poorly known but crucial parameter.  It would tell how the galaxies can complement the contribution of quasars for ionizing the IGM, especially at the epoch of re-ionization when the number density of quasars is apparently low.  Direct measurements are difficult and scarce.  Indirect evaluations using stellar population synthesis are plagued by the uncertainties on the Lyman continuum (\Lyc) escape fraction.  We would like to take advantage of the sensitivity of FUSE down to 900 \AA~ to detect (or set significant upper limit on) the \Lyc\ radiation of nearby star-forming galaxies.  We have selected two galaxy candidates with a redshift large enough to get rid of the residual galactic opacity resulting from the accumulation of the Lyman series absorption lines.
A053|1| |DIETER|REIMERS|Hamburger Sternwarte, Universitat Hamburg, Germany|We propose to probe the far-UV continuum fluxes of 15 new bright($V<17$) $2.4 < z < 2.9$ quasars from the Hamburg Bright Quasar Survey by means of single-orbit snapshot exposures, with the aim of identifying one or more suitably bright objects for detailed studies of intergalactic HeII absorption over this redshift range.  We also propose to carry out a $4 \cdot 10^{4}$~s exposure of the newly discovered quasar HS1549+1919 ($z=2.83$, $V\simeq 15.6$) -- an object that promises to reach a flux of $F_\lambda \sim 6 \times 10^{-15}$ erg~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$\thinspace{\AA}$^{-1}$ at redshifted HeII~$\lambda304$. If confirmed by its snapshot exposure, this object would be the brightest ``clear'' high redshift quasar discovered so far.  Since the detailed study of HeII absorption lies at the limit of the capabilities of {\it FUSE}, a $\simeq5$  and $\simeq 2$ times boost in signal over the two other Hamburg quasars and {\it FUSE} targets HS1700$+$6416 and HE2347$-$4342 will dramatically increase the amount and quality of information on the physical state of the intergalactic medium that can be extracted from {\it FUSE} observations of intervening HeII absorption.  
A054|1| |MATTHEW|BURLEIGH|Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester, UK|We will use {\it FUSE} to accurately determine the fundamental parameters (T$_{eff}$, log g, radius and mass) of a recently discovered sample of unresolved, optically invisible white dwarfs in Sirius-type binary systems.  Far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of the H Lyman series is the {\em only} means available to achieve this goal.  We will then use the mass determinations to investigate the initial-to-final mass relation for white dwarf stars.  In addition, {\it Hipparcos} provides us with well constrained parallaxes for ten of the primaries in this sample.  We will use this data, together with the parameters determined with {\it FUSE}, to retrieve the stellar masses and hence test the empirical mass-radius relation, comparing it with that for isolated stars.  Finally, we will search for evidence of elements heavier than He in these hot stars' photospheres and in the circumstellar environment, and determine their abundances.
A058|1| |ERIC|MILLER|Department of Astronomy, University of Michigan, USA|Molecular absorption line studies and X-ray absorption observations towardextragalactic sight lines indicate that molecular gas is as abundant as neutral atomic gas in the Solar vicinity. At larger Galactic radii, H$_{2}$ exceeds HI in some locations, and if this is generally true, it implies a dramatic revision in the picture of neutral gas in disk galaxies. To determine if H$_{2}$ dominates the ISM at large radii, we propose to measure the H$_{2}$ column toward AGNs projected behind the outer parts of two external disk galaxies with measured HI columns.
A060|1| |ANURADHA|KORATKAR|Space Telescope Science Institute, USA|A well known feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the Big Blue Bump (BBB) continuum component which extends from 1 \micron\ to soft X-rays, containing more than half the bolometric emission of an unobscured AGN.  Its origin is directly related to the main energy production mechanism.  Theoretical arguments based on accretion disk models and on photoionization models suggested that the BBB peaks in the EUV.  However, recent UV observations by Zheng et al.  and soft X-ray observations by Laor et al.  suggest the FUV turns over just below 1000~\AA\ and extends as a single power-law to $\sim$1~keV.  This very surprising spectral shape has important implications for both accretion disk and photoionization models.  Since there is no overlap between the high $z\simeq 1$ UV and low $z\simeq 0.2$ soft X-ray samples, it is not clear whether the implied SED in fact holds for any individual quasar.  We propose here to obtain complete FUV coverage of a sample of 23 low $z$ PG quasars, for which high quality soft X-ray spectra are available.  The combined {\em ROSAT PSPC+FUSE} spectra will allow us to set the most accurate constraints on the ionizing SED of quasars from both sides of the Galactic opacity barrier (at 912~\AA-0.15~keV).  This will allow us to test directly, and in each object, whether the FUV indeed turns over below 1000~\AA\ into a single power-law which matches the 0.15-1~keV power-law.  This sample was studied extensively and systematically in nearly all spectral bands, and highly significant correlations were found among the optical, UV and soft X-ray emission properties, providing important hints for the physical processes which shape AGN emission properties.  The {\em FUSE} data will allow us to explore the expected correlations with FUV emission lines.  A few of the objects in this sample show UV and soft X-ray absorption.  Higher spectral resolution observations proposed for some of these objects will provide important clues on the nature and possible association between the X-ray and UV absorbers.
A061|1| |JOHN|HUTCHINGS|Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, HIA, NRC of Canada, Cana|We propose FUSE observations of the brightest OB stars in the local group galaxies M31 and M33.  The stars are faint but their UV fluxes are known from HST and UIT data.  This will extend the stellar wind and interstellar studies currently under way with HST and ground-based telescopes, with similar resolution (1000) and S/N.  The program will expand our comparison of stellar winds, evolution, and the ISM among the major galaxies of the local group.
A063|1| |ADOLF|WITT|Department of Physics & Astronomy, The University of Toledo,|We propose to observe the three reflection nebulae NGC 2023, NGC 7023, and IC 435 and their illuminating stars with the aim to derive the dust scattering properties in three systems with widely differing far-UV extinction curves.  The wavelength dependence of extinction in the 90-120 nm range in these three nebulae will be determined by the pair method, employing the far-UV SEDs of four lightly reddened comparison stars of appropriate spectral types, also to be observed as part of this project.  Dust scattering properties in the form of wavelength-dependent values for the albedo and the phase function asymmetry will be derived with the use of Monte-Carlo multiple scattering models and with substantial reference to earlier analyses of these objects carried out at longer UV, visible, and near-IR wavelengths by the PI and his collaborators.  The results will aid in the identification of the nature of the grains responsible for the steep far-UV rise in the interstellar extinction curve, and they will provide essential input parameters for models of the far-UV diffuse galactic light and for models treating the radiative transfer in dusty galaxies.  
A065|1| |JOHN|RAYMOND|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, USA|Herbig-Haro object shock waves are visible in Balmer lines and forbidden lines in the optical and in $\rm H_2$ ro-vibrational transitions in the infrared.  A few HH objects are seen in $\rm H_2$ Lyman and Werner bands in the UV.  HUT observations of HH2 have raised the question of the excitation mechanism of this UV emission, and the answer bears directly upon the physics of the shocks themselves.  FUSE has the spectral resolution to determine whether the 1050 $\rm \AA$ and 1100 $\rm \AA$ features result from fluorescence of Ly$\alpha$ photons or from collisional excitation by electrons.  The line widths, which may be as large as 125 km/s, will be a valuable constraint on the models, and the observation will detect lines of C III and O VI if they are present at 1/3 the upper limits from HUT.  
A066|1| |JOHN|RAYMOND|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, USA|FUSE measurements of the O VI doublet in non-radiative shock waves provide unique diagnostics for the physics of collisionless shock waves (ion-ion and electron-ion equilibration) as well as a means to observe the onset of radiative cooling.  It is necessary to understand these processes in order to derive the physical parameters and the evolutionary states of supernova remnants and other astrophysical shocks.  We propose to observe two filaments in the Cygnus Loop.  One is a 300 km/s pure non-radiative shock.  The other is a crisp filament seen in the light of [Ne V] which marks the encounter between the main supernova remnant blast wave and a large, dense cloud.
A068|1| |JOEL|BREGMAN|Department of Astronomy, University of Michigan, USA|The fundamental prediction of the cooling flow model for hot gas in elliptical galaxies is that the hot gas loses its thermal energy and becomes cool gas, typically at a rate of 1 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for X-ray bright ellipticals.  The most powerful test of this model would be the detection of cooling gas at $\sim10^{5.5}$ K, when it has lost more than 90\% of it thermal energy.  OVI emitting gas is produced in this temperature range and the predicted luminosity is high enough that this gas should be easily observable by FUSE with the LWRS aperture.  Measurements of OVI emission for our five galaxies of different $\dot M$ permit two important tests of the cooling flow picture, while non-detections will lead to severe limits, $\dot M < 0.04 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and a dismissal of the model.
A070|1| |PATRICK|BOISSE|Laboratoire de Radioastronomie, Ecole Normale Superieure, Pa|We propose to investigate the very small scale structure (l $\simeq$ 5 - 10 AU) in the molecular, atomic and ionized phases of the interstellar medium by repeatedly observing a bright runaway O star located behind a translucent molecular cloud.  The selected star, HD 34078 (AE Aur) moves at a transverse velocity of 103 km/s and the spectra taken during cycle 1 at three distinct epochs separated by 3-4 months will allow to sample adjacent lines of sight distant by $\simeq$ 5 AU at the cloud distance.  The spectral range covered by FUSE is very well suited to conduct a coordinated search for small amplitude fluctuations of the column density for molecules (H$_2$, $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, ...), atoms (CI, SI, ...) and ions (SiII, CII, FeII, ...).  By performing a detailed comparison of the absorption lines detected in the three successive spectra, we expect to significantly improve the characterization of the ubiquitous AU-scale structure in the ISM and better understand its nature and origin.  The properties of the proposed source as well as those of the interstellar gas along the line of sight are well characterized by previous observations (IUE, high resolution optical spectroscopy), which makes HD 34078 an ideal target for this project.  Depending on the results obtained from cycle 1 observations, we will propose to extend the monitoring of the absorption lines during cycle 2 and/or 3, especially in order to investigate the variability on larger scales (l $\simeq$ 30 - 50 AU).  If no variations are detected among cycle 1 spectra, the observations proposed will at least permit a detailed study of a well documented line of sight.  
A075|1| |JON|MORSE|Center for Astrophysics and Space Astronomy, University of C|We propose to obtain \fuse\ far-UV spectroscopic observations of the oxygen-rich supernova remnants N132D in the LMC and E0102.2--7219 in the SMC.  The \fuse\ spectra will be coupled with our existing \hst\ FOS spectra and scheduled \axaf\ GTO spectra of the uncontaminated SN debris to provide complete, unprecedented sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the emission from the X-rays to the near-IR.  We will compare the observed line ratios to predictions made by theoretical models in order to determine the excitation mechanisms and to derive reliable elemental abundances.  Of primary importance is to measure the O~VI $\lambda\lambda1032$ emission from these objects with \fuse, which is key to determining the relative importance of collisional ionization and photoionization for producing the observed emission.  N132D and E0102.2--7219 are the only O-rich SNRs that can be spatially resolved {\it and} studied effectively at UV wavelengths.  The combined \fuse\ + \hst\ + \axaf\ data will provide important tests for theories of nucleosynthesis in massive stars as well as improve our understanding of the dynamics of supernova explosions and mixing in the ejecta.
A083|1| |EDWARD|GUINAN|Dept. of Astronomy, Villanova University, USA|We propose to use FUSE for an in-depth study of the evolution of the transition region and low corona of a solar-mass star throughout its main-sequence lifetime.  This program is part of a comprehensive study of the ``Sun in Time'' across the electromagnetic spectrum.  We have defined a homogeneous sample of single G0-5~V stars with well-known rotation periods that are proxies of the Sun at different ages.  We intend to study dynamics of the lower layers of the stellar atmospheres by investigating line shifts, line asymmetries, and line broadenings that we presume are related to chromospheric evaporation by high-energy processes identified in the overlying corona.  Emission measure and temperature analysis will allow us to obtain a complete 3-D atmospheric model of active regions that we will link to the previously obtained coronal X-ray data.  We will infer transition region pressures through the powerful density-sensitive ratio of the C~III 977\AA/1176\AA\ lines; this important diagnostic will be adequate to identify and model the relevant magnetic structures based on the solar analogy, and, together with our coronal X-ray (ROSAT, ASCA, SAX), EUV (EUVE), and TR (IUE/HST) data, to infer the importance of coronal energy releases.  Our FUSE investigation is central to the understanding of the evolution of magneto-dynamic atmospheric phenomena, and the associated high-energy emissions in the Sun and in solar-type stars.  It also bears on the question of the young Sun's influence on the developing planetary system.  The FUSE observations will further be used to estimate the important D/H ratio along the sightlines to the stars, and to search for the presence of stellar analogs to the solar wind.  Coordinated /contemporaneous observations (with XMM, ROSAT, HST, optical photometers, partly from guaranteed time programs) are planned and will be organized.
A084|1| |CHRISTOPHER|MAUCHE|Astrophysics Group, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, |We propose to obtain high spectral resolution orbit- and spin-phase resolvedFUV spectra of the intermediate polar EX~Hya. These spectra will be used to (1) resolve the FUV emission lines into their various components to constrain the location of, and the physical conditions in, the line-emitting gas, (2) measure the strength and phasing of the narrow absorption features to determine the column density through, and the ionization state of, the bulge on the edge of the accretion disk, and (3) measure the continuum flux distribution in the FUV and its variation on the spin and binary phases to constrain the effective temperature and area of the hot spot on the surface of the white dwarf and the effective temperature of the truncated inner disk.
A085|1| |HARRIET|DINERSTEIN|Astronomy Department, University of Texas at Austin, USA|In the last few years has it become clear that planetary nebulae (PNe) are not quite what they seem to be at first glance: they are {\it not} simply fully ionized circumstellar nebulae.  Instead, for most PNe the ionized gas is merely the innermost zone of a massive, mostly neutral, circumstellar envelope.  These neutral/molecular envelopes have been studied by the PI and her collaborators via fluorescently-pumped near-infrared H$_2$ emission lines, far-infrared emission lines such as [O I] 63 $\mu$m, and, most recently, optical Na I absorption lines.  We propose to use FUSE to obtain high-resolution spectra of the central stars, using their continua as backdrops for observing UV absorption lines of key neutral and molecular species, in order to determine excitation temperatures, column densities, and other properties of these envelopes.  This study will connect tightly to existing and future optical and infrared observations, as well as to previous GRHS and upcoming STIS programs.  The FUSE observations are particularly important because {\it only} with FUSE will it be possible to directly observe the H$_2$ Lyman and Werner bands, the very lines that pump the cascade that produces the infrared H$_2$ lines.  With their high-surface-brightness infrared line emission, PNe provide a remarkable opportunity for tying together the absorption and emission components of the H$_2$ fluorescence process, now known to be widespread in the ISM.  FUSE will also enable us to measure the populations of the fine-structure levels of the $^3$P ground state of O I and connect these to far-infrared line observations by the PI of [O I] 63 $\mu$m, the primary coolant for the warm atomic gas in PNe, and [O I] 145 $\mu$m.  In addition, FUSE will sample lines of other species such as C I and Cl I, as well as revealing new spectral features from the central stars.  From this study we will learn about both the physics of UV-illuminated nebulae (``PDRs" or ``photodissociation regions") and about this enigmatic phase of stellar evolution, during which most of the stellar envelope is removed.
A086|1| |WILLIAM|KEEL|Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Univ. of Alabama-Tuscaloosa,|We propose a program of FUSE spectroscopy of star-forming regions in local galaxies to complement planned observations with the STARLITE far-UV shuttle hitch-hiker payload (which offers excelent diffuse-source sensitivity and spatial resolution at the expense of point-source performance and spectral resolution).  The two datasets would complement each other uniquely for understanding the overall far-UV spatial and spectral morphology of these galaxies, an important first step toward being able to interpret this passband as seen optically in high-redshift galaxies.  We concentrate on M33, whose combination of proximity and star-forming rate makes it especially amenable for this comparison.  The S/N requirements are designed to allow separation of the lines in the Lyman $\beta$/O VI/C II blend which are diagnostic of the massive-star mix (particularly unevolved versus evolved stars), which has proven very difficult to unravel at longer wavelengths.  Comparing the two data sets will tell whether the brightest star-forming regions are representative of the overall FUV-emitting population, and will be used to search for scattering effects.  These data will enable us to interpret observations of high-redshift galaxies (higher every month now) in a more realistic context than yet possible.
A088|1| |THOMAS|BROWN|Lab. for Astronomy and Solar Physics, NASA/GSFC, USA|Because they are composed of old, passively evolving populations,elliptical galaxies offer great promise for tracing the evolution of the Universe.  Their apparent simplicity makes them the first beachhead in the quest to understand galactic evolution, and if they evolve slowly enough, they can be calibrated as standard candles at great distances.  The hot stars responsible for the ``UV upturn'' phenomenon are key indicators of age and abundance in ellipticals.  These stars are well isolated in the {\it FUSE} wavelength range from the cooler main sequence stars that complicate interpretation at wavelengths longer than 2000~\AA.  We propose to observe three ellipticals through the {\it FUSE} $30 \times 30^{\prime\prime}$ aperture: NGC~221, NGC~4649, and NGC~1399.  Although NGC~221 is a fundamental testing ground for theories of stellar and galactic evolution, its spectrum has never been measured below Lyman $\alpha$.  NGC~4649 and NGC~1399 were observed by {\it HUT}, but at considerably lower signal-to-noise and resolution than possible with {\it FUSE}.  With {\it FUSE} data, the absorption lines of C, N, and Si prevalent in the far-UV will provide invaluable composition diagnostics for the hot stellar populations in ellipticals.  Furthermore, {\it FUSE} is uniquely qualified to measure the Lyman series, an important diagnostic of effective temperature and surface gravity.  {\it FUSE} presents the opportunity to finally and unequivocally characterize the population responsible for the UV upturn.
A090|1| |VLADIMIR|KRASNOPOLSKY|Department of Physics, Catholic University of America, USA|We propose to detect H$_2$ on Mars by observing its spectrum with FUSE in the beginning of June 1999 with integration time of 18 ks.  This observation will also allow studying the far UV spectrum of Mars with an unprecendented quality.  H$_2$ is probably the most abundant species which has not been observed on Mars.  Photochemical models predict its mixing ratio from 7 to 50 ppm.  The upper limit to the H$_2$ density of $1.1\times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ at the altitude of 560 km was established using the Mariner 9 ultraviolet spectrometer observations.  This limit is very close to the value which is required to explain the densities of atomic hydrogen observed with Mariner 6, 7, and 9.  A spectrum of Mars observed with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope does not show H$_2$ emissions.  This may raise a problem of a H$_2$ deficit on Mars, and a possible detection with FUSE may be of crucial importance.  The most sensitive method for spectroscopic detection of H$_2$ is observations of the P1 (6-v'') lines of the H$_2$ Lyman band system.  These lines are much stronger than other H$_2$ lines due to their excitation by the solar Lyman-beta line, the effect discovered by one of us (PDF) twenty five years ago.  However, the expected intensities are low, a few tenths of rayleigh, even for these lines.  The unique sensitivity and resolution of FUSE will allow detection of H$_2$ in the upper atmosphere of Mars.  Extrapolation of the measured abundance to the lower atmosphere will result in the H$_2$ mixing ratio with an uncertainty of 30\%.  Thus, H$_2$ can be measured for the first time on Mars, and FUSE can provide a key measurement which was impossible for the numerous spacecraft that visited Mars.
A093|1| |STEVEN|SHORE|Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, Indiana University South Ben|We propose target of opportunity observations of classical novae in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud in the early stages of outburst.  The FUV represents the final frontier in the study of the early history of the expansion of nova ejecta, when the overlying optically thick metallic line absorption spectrum (called the ``iron curtain'') lifts and it is possible to see through the ejected shell to the deepest layers of the still optically thick ejecta.  During the period following the explosion, the central source illuminates the ejecta.  To date, only three novae have been observed in the region from 900 - 1200\AA, V1974 Cyg 1992 (Voyager UVS, ORFEUS), Cir 1995 (HUT), and Aql 1995 (HUT).  The 1995 novae were observed only at relatively low resolution with HUT during the ASTRO-2 mission and within one month of outburst, while V1974 Cyg was observed nearly 4 years after maximum and only with limited S/N.  The ability to correctly model the outburst, determine the abundances in the ejecta, and obtain a comprehensive picture of the energetics of the outburst can only be achieved through multiwavelength observations.  The FUV plays a vital part in these studies.
A094|1| |ROBERT|BENJAMIN|Dept. of Physics, University of Wisconsin, USA|We propose to simultaneously search for diffuse \OVI~ emission and\OVI~ absorption in the same direction for which Martin \& Bowyer (MB) detected \CIV~ 1549 \AA~ emission: $l=155$, $b=58$.  This is also the direction of the ``Lockman window''.  For \OVI~ absorption, we will use the compact UV bright galaxy Mk 153 as a background source.  Measurement of Galactic \OVI~ absorption and emission along the same line of sight will determine the density and pressure of the hot gas.  Our results will be combined with MB's \CIV~ 1549 \AA~ and \OIII] 1662 \AA~ detections, as well as optical $H \alpha$, [S II], and [O III] emission from the Wisconsin $H \alpha$ Mapper, and $\onequarter {\rm -keV}$ X-ray shadowing studies of this region.  Comparison with calculations of nonequilibrium cooling flows will be used to constrain models for the origin of this hot gas and determine whether the gas pressure is high enough to drive a ``galactic fountain'' flow.
A099|1| |KAREN|LEIGHLY|Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory, Columbia University, USA|It has long been thought that the shape of the ionizing continuum of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) should have an effect on its emission-line ratios.  This is important since the line ratios then potentially provide a way to infer shape of the continuum in the unobservable EUV wavelength range.  It was suspected that the ratio of \ion{O}{6} to Ly$\alpha$ should be especially sensitive to this shape: \ion{O}{6} should be strong when the continuum in the optical--UV--soft X-ray range is hard.  Among the recently presented observational evidence lending support for this idea are the {\it HUT} spectra showing that some Seyfert 1 galaxies with strong X-ray soft excesses have also strong \ion{O}{6} lines.  The Seyfert 1 galaxy RE~1034+38 has a remarkable spectral energy distribution. Its optical and UV spectra are very red, but there is no evidence for absorption.  Its soft X-rays are very strong, with a steep spectrum.  Such a hard ionizing continuum should produce a huge \ion{O}{6} line.  We propose a 50~ks {\it FUSE} observation of RE~1034+39 to test the extreme limits of the trend for strong \ion{O}{6} to accompany a hard ionizing continuum.  This observation will enhance our understanding of the influence of the continuum shape on the production of the strong broad emission lines in AGN.  The signal to noise in the resulting spectrum should be good enough that we can resolve the line, and measure strong deviations of the continuum from a power law.  Coordinated {\it ASCA} and optical spectroscopic observations are planned as well as accretion disk and photoionization modeling.
A100|1| |GRAHAM|HARPER|CASA, University of Colorado, USA|The FUV radiation field of evolved late-K and M stars, which is dominated by H Lyman emission lines, controls the ionization balance of key atomic and ionic species, the dissociation equilibrium of molecular H$_2$ and CO, and provides crucial information on the excitation of hydrogen.  FUSE observations of the FUV flux below $1044$\AA{ } will allow us to constrain the Ca~II/Ca~III balance and remove a key uncertainty in previous studies on stellar mass-loss rates.  The FUV photoionization flux was previously {\it unknown}, but FUSE spectra can unlock the wealth of information from early optical studies of Ca~II.  We propose to construct detailed radiative transfer models from the H Lyman $\beta$ and $\gamma$ line profiles.  These models will provide constraints on the hydrogen ionization, the dominant source of electrons in chromospheres, and the formation of the Lyman continuum which is not directly observable.  FUSE will also allow us to observe wind induced line profile asymmetries and to constrain with great sensitivity the volume of $\sim 3\times 10^5$~K plasma which traditional ``non-coronal'' stars are now thought to possess.  We propose deep exposures of the brightest K bright giant ($\alpha$~TrA K3~II), the brightest K supergiant ($\lambda$~Vel K4~Ib), and two of the brightest M giants ($\gamma$~Cru M3~III, $\beta$~Gru M5~III).  These stars have been studied extensively in the UV and optical, and we have recently obtained the first radio detections for all these targets.  We will incorporate the knowledge gathered from the FUV into our unified chromospheric/wind models for these stars.  These spectra will provide a valuable complement to the spectral-types and evolutionary phases of the GTO targets.  FUV spectra of the M stars will provide crucial input physics for circumstellar photochemistry.
A106|1| |ERIKA|BOHM-VITENSE|Astronomy Department, University of Washington, USA|We propose to obtain additional empirical constraints on the atmospheric heating mechanisms operating in stellar transition regions (TR) and coronae.  In particular, we will address the question of whether different heating mechanisms may be working in different layers of a given star and whether the relative importance of the mechanisms changes from star to star.  The heating mechanisms may depend on T$_{eff}$, gravity, rotation, magnetic fields, age, chemical composition, and, possibly, binarity.  In order to identify the heating mechanisms, we need to disentangle the dependences on all these parameters.  We propose to do this by observing the 1032 \& 1038~\AA\ O~VI emission lines in a large sample of main sequence Hyades F stars.  These stars are chosen since they are the brightest cluster stars with strong TR-emission and because marked changes in the heating mechanisms apparently occur around spectral type F5, leading to easily-observable effects on our spectral diagnostics.  In addition, the age, chemical composition, and surface gravity of these stars are essentially the same, removing dependences on 3 of the stellar parameters.  Relations between the lower-TR and upper-TR emissions, together with their relationships to the coronal X-ray emission will tell us the relationship between heating mechanisms in the different layers.  We already have reliable lower-TR emission line (e.g.  C~IV) measurements for 15 Hyades F stars observed by IUE and will be obtaining such for 17 additional Hyades F stars in an approved Cycle 7 HST program.  FUSE will provide the critically needed flux measurements of upper-TR lines (O~VI), as well as of an additional lower-TR line, C~III.
A108|1| |VAN|DIXON|Space Sciences Laboratory, The University of California, Ber|We propose to obtain \fuse\ spectra of four hot post-asymptotic giant branch (PAGB) stars in globular clusters: ROB 162 in NGC 6397, ZNG 1 in NGC 5904 (M5), ROA 5342 in NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), and III-60 in NGC 6723.  These stars have temperatures greater than 40,000 K and are located in globular clusters with well-known distances, metallicities, and ages.  Despite their short ($\sim 10^5$ yr) lifetimes, hot PAGB stars may contribute significantly to the enrichment of the interstellar medium, the photoionization of the halo, and the integrated ultraviolet flux of old stellar populations.  We will model the \fuse\ spectra with non-LTE line-blanketed stellar atmospheres in order to derive the stars' effective temperatures and surface gravities and the abundances of important species such as carbon, nitrogen, and silicon.  These parameters will be used to set constraints on processes such as mass-loss and dredge-up on the AGB, superwinds at the AGB turnoff, and the white dwarf mass in globular clusters.
A109|1| |FREDERICK|WALTER|Department of Physics and Astronomy, State University of New|The circumstellar disks of young stellar objects are likely to be dominated by hydrogen molecules (H$_{2}$).  Using the HST/GHRS, we detected strong permitted H$_2$ Lyman band emission from a sample of classical T~Tauri stars.  These bands arise either through fluorescent pumping by strong stellar emission lines or by shock heating.  We propose FUSE observations of the H$_2$ Werner bands.  These could be fluoresced by stellar O~VI emission, by shock heating, or by thermal processes at 1000~K.  Measurement of these fluxes will greatly assist our study of the gaseous circumstellar environments of pre-main sequence stars.
A111|1| |YOU-HUA|CHU|Department of Astronomy, University of Illinois, USA|We are studying the interfaces between hot (\dex6\,K) and warm (\dex4\,K) gas in the superbubble N\,51\,D in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  N\,51\,D provides a well defined closed environment with known distance, size, kinetic and thermal energy.  We have X-ray, radio and optical data and have been allocated time to obtain HST-STIS spectra for 4 lines of sight.  The STIS spectra include lines of \NV, \CIV, \SiIV, and lower ionization species, and the four probe stars sample different projected distances from the center of the superbubble.  We propose to use FUSE spectra of these four stars.  Two are already on the reserved-target list, we request time for the other two.  The integration times will be $\sim$10\,ks in three cases, so that we can obtain the O\,VI emission as well as the \OVI\ absorption.  The FUSE spectra will yield information on \CI, \CIII, \NI, \NII\ and \NIII, so that we will have spectra for four ionization stages of C and N.  Taken together, these data will allow a determination of the density, pressure and ionization of \dex2\,K, \dex4\,K, \dex5\,K and \dex6\,K gas in N\,51\,D.
A117|1| |RICHARD|LIEU|Dept of Physics, University of Alabama-Huntsville, USA|A new component of diffuse soft X-ray and EUV emission has been found in all of the five clusters hitherto observed.  In some clusters the soft excess is as luminous as that of the well-known intracluster X-rays.  A thermal origin involves large quantities of warm gas, but was predicted by Cen and Ostriker whose cold dark matter model puts 55 \% of the present day baryons in this gas.  Several authors also suggested a non-thermal (inverse-Compton) interpretation.  Both scenarios have their pros and cons, and only further observations by better techniques can lead to a verdict.  This proposal concerns a very effective means of gathering independent evidence for the thermal model.  If warm gas is indeed present in such vast amounts one will expect prominent O VI emission lines.  Previous missions failed to detect them, but their upper limits were not particularly constraining.  With the much improved sensitivity of FUSE, one can now make definitive statements about the existence or otherwise of intracluster gas at the temperatures inferred from the soft excess measurements.  We suggest observations at various radii of the three brightest soft excess clusters, to measure the spatial distribution of warm gas.
A118|1| |MICHAEL|WOLFF|Space Science Institute USA|Understanding interstellar dust and its role in the universe is very important.  Virtually all observations of astrophysical objects and their physical processes are affected by the presence of dust either within the system being studied or along its line of sight.  We propose a research program that will significantly improve our knowledge of dust properties, specifically those of small grains.  Such an advance has not been possible prior to the advent of FUSE and its unique capabilities: the high far ultraviolet (FUV) throughput and the ability to resolve H$_2$ lines, combined with a well-characterized instrumental calibration.  We will derive FUV extinction curves for several types of sightlines which possess distinct signatures associated with the small grain population and whose mid-UV extinction curves reveal vastly differing amounts of intermediate-sized particles.  In addition to a variety of important Galactic sightlines (\ie\ extreme values of $R_V$, polarized 2175~\AA\ feature), we include objects in each of the Magellanic Clouds where very non-Galactic mid-ultraviolet extinction properties are seen.  These data will be used to probe and constrain the properties of the small dust grains, such as abundance and size, and their connection to the very different environments observed.
A120|1| |PETER|WANNIER|Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technolog|FUSE observations of interstellar H$_2$ will enable a breakthrough study of the cool atomic and molecular gas (CAMM) associated with dense molecular clouds.  We propose to initiate such a systematic study of the extended halos around four nearby clouds, which have been well characterized using radio and infrared techniques.  The H$_2$ absorption-line spectra toward hot background stars will yield (1) direct H$_2$ column densities, (2) gas kinetic temperatures and (3) the diffuse UV radiative intensity.  From the information in the atomic Lyman series and HD absorption lines, we will estimate (1) the atomic column density, yielding information about the space density, and (2) the cosmic ray ionization rate.  In addition to the proposed FUSE observations, we plan an independently-funded observational program which will provide vitally-needed information about the cloud kinematics.  For the FUSE sightlines, we will obtain optical spectra of CH and other species, using ultra-high spectral resolution, which will reduce uncertainties in the analysis caused by systematic variations in excitation with radial velocity.
A121|1| |BRAD|GIBSON|Mount Stromlo & Siding Spring Observatories, Australian Nati|High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are an important, but poorly understood componentof the Galactic halo. Our missing knowledge of their metallicities has been a major impediment in unlocking the mystery of their origin. With FUSE a metallicity determination will be possible by observing \NI. At the same time, the properties of \OVI\ absorption associated with the HVCs tell us about the relation between hot and neutral halo gas.  Since few bright AGNs are projected on a HVC, the FUSE PI program will sample just two HVCs, which are not representative of the general population and thus the results may lead to a biased interpretation. We therefore propose to study metallicities and hot gas in the other HVC populations. Since the FUV flux is not known for any of the possible probes, we will first undertake a limited pilot survey of sightlines through several key HVCs which are not yet sampled. We will follow the identical strategy adopted by the D/H and Milky Way \OVI\ PI programs and acquire 2 ksec exposure snapshots of 11 AGN, to verify our estimated FUV fluxes, from which the 3 highest quality candidates will be identified for subsequent high signal-to-noise (60\,ksec) observations.
A123|1| |NICOLE|ST-LOUIS|Departement de physique, Universite de Montreal, Canada|We propose to secure a time sequence of ultraviolet (UV) spectra for aWR+O binary system to study the physical parameters and the structure of the bow shock zone formed when the winds of the two hot stars collide. Of particular importance in the {\sl FUSE} UV range is the presence of a broad spread of emission lines with different ionization levels, ranging from O\thinspace VI to C\thinspace III.  These lines are expected to arise in the bow shock zone at progressively larger distances from the X-ray heated bow head, as the compressed plasma flows outward along the shock cone and cools.  The study of how these lines vary with orbital phase in the 14.9-day WC4+O5-6 LMC binary Br~22 will allow us to map out the structure and kinematics of the bow shock.  This in turn will provide useful constraints on the basic parameters of the winds as well as the collision process itself.  Br~22 is a particularly good example of a system in which wind-wind collision effects are known to be strong.
A126|1| |KNOX|LONG|Space Telescope Science Institute, USA|SS Cyg and U Gem are the ``prototypical'' dwarf novae.  However, EUV and FUV spectra of the two systems in outburst are very different, probably due to the fact that the boundary layer luminosity of SS Cyg is much less than in U Gem.  We propose to exploit these differences to isolate the wind and disk signatures in dwarf novae.  By using FUSE to obtain multiple high S/N spectra of both systems through outburst, we will (1) probe the ionization and kinematic structure of the wind as a function of system brightness, (2) isolate the contributions of the disk to the FUV spectra, and (3) examine physical conditions and abundances of material just being accreted onto the disk from the secondary.  FUSE studies of dwarf novae, coupled with detailed model comparisons, are crucial to a better understanding of disks and winds in non-magnetic cataclysmic variables.
A129|1| |JOY|NICHOLS|IPAC, California Institute of Technology, USA|We propose high resolution FUSE spectra to study a recently identified interaction of the Vela supernova remnant with a dense cloud region along its western edge.  The goal is to quantify the temperature, ionization, density, and abundance characteristics associated with this shock/dense cloud interface.  Our detection of high-velocity absorption line C~I at +90 to +130 km/s with IUE toward a narrow region interior to the Vela SNR strongly suggests the Vela supernova remnant is interacting with a dense ISM or molecular cloud.  The shock/dense cloud interface is suggested by (1) the rarity of detection of high-velocity C~I seen in IUE spectra, (2) its very limited spatial distribution in the remnant, and (3) a marked decrease in X-ray emission in the region immediately west of the position of these stars where one also finds a 100 micron emission ridge in IRAS images.  We would like to investigate the shock physics and general properties of this interaction region through a focussed UV absorption line study using FUSE spectra.  FUSE is the only instrument that can obtain data that covers the tremendous range in density, temperature, and ionization that are expected.  We propose to study the supernova remnant/cloud interaction using O VI coupled with IUE data, as well as several density and temperature line diagnostics in the FUSE range.  H$_2$ absorption is also especially important to evaluate the molecular formation and abundances near the interface of the dense cloud.
A130|1| |JOHN|RICE|Department of Physics and Astronomy, Brandon University, Can|We propose to make multiple phase resolved observations of the variable magnetic chemically peculiar star 17~Com~A to improve our understanding its far-UV continuum and line opacity.  The fluxes at FUSE wavelengths are expected to be quite sensitive to abundance and temperature variations and to non-LTE effects.  These observations will allow us to directly connect flux changes below 1200 \AA\ to the known abundance variations over the stellar surface, and will allow us to test models produced from optical Doppler imaging methods.  These will permit us to look for any significant sources of opacity which are absent from our calculations.  We expect that this study will result in better determinations of photospheric structure and of the elemental abundances.
A133|1| |ALEX|FULLERTON|Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Victoria, Cana|We propose to use the unique capabilities of {\it FUSE}\ to monitor thetime-dependent behavior of the stellar wind profiles of an O4 supergiant in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  These observations will enable us to: i) observe how of the state of wind material changes as it traverses structures in the wind; ii) perform a meaningful search for the high excitation, small scale shocks that are thought to generate the X-rays from O stars; and iii) determine how wind activity is affected by metallicity.  Previous surveys and monitoring campaigns with {\it IUE}\ and {\it HST}have shown that stellar wind variability is both continuous and ubiquitous in the unsaturated P~Cygni profiles of Galactic OB stars.  However, because the Si {\sc iv} $\lambda\lambda$1400 doublet is the only unsaturated resonance wind line in early O stars available to these instruments, progress has been hampered in understanding the fundamental behavior of how the wind material evolves as it varies, and in studying the highest excitation wind structures. In contrast, the FUV region accessible to {\it FUSE}\ contains a wealth of resonance line diagnostics which will enable us to study these topics.
A134|1| |BRIAN|ESPEY|Center for Astrophysical Sciences, Johns Hopkins University,|Symbiotic stars are binary systems consisting (generally) of a type K or M giant in orbit with a white dwarf companion.  The short wavelength continuum of the white dwarf ionizes the outer atmosphere and wind of the giant, resulting in a rich nebular emission spectrum.  The lines from this gas can therefore be used to diagnose conditions both close to the giant, and also in the extended shell of wind material.  We propose to obtain emission and absorption line data on a sample of symbiotic binary systems.  High resolution far-UV data will enable us to probe the physical conditions in the highest temperature emitting gas, to diagnose conditions in the tenuous white dwarf wind, and the irradiated giant wind.  Absorption line data will enable us to probe the coolest gas in the binary systems, including molecular material close to the giant, as well as that in the circumbinary nebula.  FUSE data will extend work begun with our analysis of HST, Orfeus and HUT data and will, for the first time, permit comparison of the UV and far-UV line profiles at comparable resolution.  Temperature, density and abundance measurements using far-UV lines will provide the basis for improved models of these systems.  
A139|1| |WEI|ZHENG|Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins Universit|Of all the Seyfert Galaxies, NGC~1068, by reason of its proximity, brightness and spatially extended ionization cone provides an ideal case for spectral and spatial diagnostic mapping aimed at determining the nature of excitation mechanisms.  In particular, the far-UV lines of C {\sc iii} $\lambda 977$ and N {\sc iii} $\lambda 991$ provide a unique diagnostic capability, and can be used not only to separate between photoionization and shocks, but also to determine quantitative values of the parameters of such models.  We know from earlier Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) observations that the NGC~1068 ionization cone is characterized by very high electron temperatures.  The spatial resolution (close to HST) and the sensitivity of FUSE provide us with the only means of mapping the radial distribution of the electron temperature, and measuring the far-UV line flux data needed to uniquely determine the excitation mechanism.  We propose to make maximum use of the FUSE capabilities to: (1) map the radial distribution of electron temperature in the C {\sc iii} $\lambda 977$ and N {\sc iii} $\lambda 991$ zones; (2) investigate 'hot spots' thought to be the locations of ionizing shocks; and (3) study the spatial structure of the sharp boundary between high and low ionization zones.  For this purpose, we propose a set of observations with different slit sizes and positions to provide an optimum compromise between spatial resolution and sensitivity in the different parts of the ionization cone.  In addition, we will combine the FUSE, HST and optical data to provide a set of points on key diagnostic diagrams that we have developed to distinguish between shock and photoionization models.  These data will be analyzed using the combined shock/photoionization code {\it MAPPINGS II} to provide a realistic global model for the ionization cones.  This study will have application to other AGN, and the data serve as a Seyfert template in studies of the unified model of AGN.
A149|1| |FREDERICK|BRUHWEILER|Institute for Astrophysics & Computational Sciences/Physics,|We will use FUSE to probe the relationship between mass loss and the ultra-high ionization emission and absorption seen in the pre-white dwarfs, the hottest stars (T$_{eff}$ $\sim$ 100-170k K) in the H-R diagram.  The presence of these ultra-high ionization species signifies temperatures far in excess of the stellar photospheres.  Speculation provides two possible explanations for the ultra-high ionization features.  First, uncertain wavelengths for the detected absorption suggest slight blue-shifts and that these features are formed in shocks at the base of the wind.  Alternately, the simultaneous appearance of ultra-high ionization and lower ionization photospheric absorption might imply the stars are partially covered by "hot spots", which produce the ultra-high ionization features.  A two component wind might also explain recent far-UV observations showing strong C~III and O~VI P Cygni features in NGC~246.  We will observe five targets, RXJ~2117+3412, and the nuclei of NGC~5315, NGC~6905, NGC~6189, and NGC~2371-2.  We will use FUSE time-tagged data to search for temporal variability in the O~VI $\lambda\lambda$1032,1038 and C~III $\lambda$977 mass loss features and in the anticipated strong O~VIII $\lambda$1165 emission.  Since the time span of the FUSE observations should be comparable to the rotational period, any spectral variations due to spots should also be seen.  Correlation or variability among the O~VI, C~III, and O~VIII features would represent a fundamental first test of any model.  This study will ascertain if spherical geometry and steady-state modeling are even appropriate for modeling mass loss.  We will also use non-LTE model atmospheres and spectral synthesis codes including the effects of winds to estimate elemental abundance patterns from lines of C, N, O, and Fe and mass loss rates from O~VI and C~III from the observed FUSE spectra.
A151|1| |JOHN|CLARKE|Space Physics Research Lab., University of Michigan, USA|Neutral atoms from the local ISM flow into the solar system producing diffuse emissions through resonant scattering of solar emissions.  This wind contains the velocity distribution of the local ISM, plus modifications by solar gravity and radiation pressure near the Sun.  In addition, the H atom motions are modified by charge exchange collisions with fast protons in the heliospheric interface region, while He atoms are little affected by charge exchange.  Recent observations of the He and H flows in the solar system suggest that the He velocity of 26\kms is that of the local ISM cloud, while the lower H velocity of 18-21\kms and greatly increased velocity dispersion in the flow direction are due to an interface modification of the H flow.  Remote observations of the H flow thereby provide a method to remotely study the heliospheric interface.  The H flow has been studied from H {\lya} line profiles at high spectral resolution observed by Copernicus, IUE, and HST, using the Earth orbital motion to Doppler shift the ISM from the geocoronal emission.  One serious ambiguity in the interpretation of these data results from the optically thick {\lya} emission, leading to uncertainties in derived values of the H density.  Using FUSE to observe the brightness and line profile of the optically thin H \lyb line, close in time to SOHO observations of the {\lya} emission, we can determine accurately the optical depth and density n(H) along lines of sight upwind, downwind, and cross-flow.  Comparing n(H) with the heliospheric helium density, and with the interstellar cloud HI/HeI ratio measured recently by the EUVE, will give the fraction of H atoms removed by charge exchange at the entrance to the heliosphere, and then the Local Cloud (or ambient ISM) electron density which governs the size of the heliosphere.  We request FUSE sky aperture spectra in the two narrow science apertures obtained during other pointed observations, through cooperation in scheduling pointed observations in the correct look directions at the proper times of year.
A155|1| |GERALDINE|PETERS|Space Sciences Center, University of Southern California, US|We propose FUSE observations of the interacting binaries TT~Hya (B9.5Ve+K1III-IV) \& V356~Sgr (B2V+A2II) during total eclipse to determine the physical conditions in the bipolar flows these systems. The polar flows are inferred from HST/FOS  UV spectropolarimetry that reveals polarizations of 30\% \& 4\% (TT~Hya \& V356~Sgr, respectively) in the faint continuum light of the B star that has been scattered into our line-of-sight by free electrons in this region.  {\it During totality, only the light from the bipolar region will be observed in the FUSE/FUV}.  Based upon eclipse observations of these stars with {\it HST} we expect to see a scattered continuum ($\sim$5\% of the B star's light) and broad (FW$\sim$800--1200~$\rm km~s^{-1}$) emission resonance lines from C~II,III, N~II,III, O~VI, S~IV, and Fe~III.  Analysis of the strengths, profiles, and structure of the resonance lines will provide information on the ionization temperature and density, and variations of these features throughout eclipse will allow us to investigate geometry and especially separate the equatorial component of the plasma near the primary from the more extended bipolar flow region.  The bipolar flows in a disk (TT~Hya) and non-disk system (V356~Sgr)will be compared.  This study will lead to a better understanding of the accretion process (that must supply the energy to power the flow) and the formation of bipolar flows in interacting binaries that do not contain compact objects.
B001|2| |LUCIANA|BIANCHI|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose to observe with FUSE a sample of Planetary Nebulae in theLarge Magellanic Cloud for which we have analysed HST UV and optical spectra.  The flux is dominated by nebular continuum in the HST range.  Instead, the far-UV spectrum will provide a direct measurement of the stellar continuum, enabling a better measurement of stellar temperature and absolute luminosity, useful to refine post-AGB evolution and nebular ionization modeling.  The FUSE spectra will also reveal the hottest layers of the stellar wind, yielding an accurate measurement of the terminal velocity and mass loss rate, which is important to model the nebular dynamics, and to understand the central stars properties and evolution.  The H_2 transitions in the FUSE range provide a powerful way to measure the circumstellar molecular gas, which - added to the mass of the central star, and of the ionized shell previously determined, will allow us to test theoretical initial-final mass relations.  The far-UV data will be a unique and valuable contribution to constrain the stellar and nebular properties of these objects, which are effectively at a single, unambiguous distance.
B003|2| |BARRY Y.|WELSH|UC Berkeley|We shall probe the ionization state and kinematics of the lowerhalo-Local Bubble interaction region using hot white dwarf stars of known, increasing distance away from the galactic plane up to z sim 0.3 kpc that of neutral gas. Our main goal is to obtain better constraints on the location of the hot gas of the Local Bubble and the associated conductive interfaces. We shall also search for signs of the infall or outflow of neutral andor ionized gas in this particular region (which could be related to a galactic fountain), and investigate the way the kinetic temperature, electron density, element abundancesdepletions and gross velocity structure of gas in the Local Bubble varies as a function of increasing height above the galactic disk as it merges into the lower galactic halo.
B004|2| |TIMOTHY|HECKMAN|Johns Hopkins University|Starbursts are a significant component of the present-day universe,and offer unique laboratories for both studying the processes that have regulated the formation and evolution of galaxies, and for testing models of high-mass stellar evolution. We propose to exploit the unique strengths of FUSE to obtain high-resolution (15 to 20 km s^-1) high quality SN sim 10) spectra of the four most powerful UV-bright starbursts in the local universe. These have bolometric luminosities comparable to the Lyman Break galaxies at z sim3. Together with the lower-power starbursts observed by FUSE in Cycle 1, the sample will span nearly the entire ranges of luminosity and metallicity seen in local starbursts.  The spectra will be used to study 1) the coronal-phase gas that may dominate the energetics of starburst-driven superwinds 2) the H_2 that probably dominates the ISM mass and regulates the star-formation ) the starburst dust-attenuation law in the unexplored FUV window 4) the stellar content of the starburst (thereby probing the IMF and burst history).  The relatively large FUSE apertures allow us to obtain high-resolution spectra of nearly the entire starburst (rather than small pieces, as with HST and STIS).
B006|2| |BRAM|BOROSON|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|We propose to investigate the mass transfer in the important Z sourceX-ray binaries by resolving the far-UV emission lines in Scorpius X-1 to reveal Doppler-shifted velocities.  The far UV region contains strong emission lines that are sensitive to X-ray illumination and provide valuable diagnostics of physical conditions in the accretion disk.  We will use the strengths of ionO6, ionC3, and ionN3 lines as density, temperature, optical depth, and abundance diagnostics.  Covering an entire 0.787 day binary orbit will allow us to look for orbital Doppler shifts and to apply the method of Doppler tomography.  We will search for variability on time scales of seconds, resulting, for example, from reprocessing of an X-ray flare by the accretion disk.
B008|2| |BRAM|BOROSON|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|HerculesX-1 is the prototypical X-ray binary pulsar, and isfortuitously located behind a very low column density of absorbing gas.  We propose to observe the far UV spectrum continuously for a complete binary orbit.  From our previous HSTSTIS observations, we expect to be able to separate broad and narrow emission line components, probably due to the accretion disk and X-ray heated atmosphere of the normal star.  Concentrating on the O 6 doublet will allow us to probe higher degrees of X-ray ionization than the lines seen with STIS, and with the larger wavelength separation of the doublets, there will be less of the confusing overlap presentin the STIS spectra.  From the data, we will form Doppler tomograms, search for evidence of a stellar wind driven from the companion or the accretion disk by X-ray heating, and look for reprocessed pulsations or UV quasiperiodic oscillations.  We can measure temperatures using the C,IIIlambda977,1176 lines and densities using the ionN3lambda990 Bowen line.
B010|2| |YOU-HUA|CHU|University of Illinois|The H,sc ii region N11B in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) containsan OB association that is dominated by main-sequence members and contains several O3 stars, the most massive of stars.  The velocity dispersion of the 10^4 K ionized gas in N11B is among the smallest in LMC H,sc ii regions.  The stellar content and gas kinematics suggest that N11B is a pristine H,sc ii region in which no supernova explosion has occurred.  Thus, N11B provides an ideal site to study the interaction between fast stellar winds and the interstellar medium (ISM).  medskip We request FUSE observations of nine stars in N11B.  These nine stars span a large spatial coverage along the E-W direction and a wide range of spectral types from O3 to B1.  Only one of the stars, an O5.5V, is surrounded by a visible ring nebula, indicating the existence of a wind-blown bubble.  The FUSE observations of the O,sc vi lines will allow us to map the distribution of hot gas in N11B and to study how fast stellar winds interact with the ambient ISM.  We also request an observation of a comparison target in a neighboring superbubble to diagnose possible spillover of its hot gas and large-scale foreground ISM structures at the same velocity.
B013|2| |NICOLE|ST-LOUIS|Universite de Montreal|We propose to secure a time sequence of ultraviolet (UV) spectra for aseries of WR+O binary systems to study the physical parameters and the structure of the bow shock zone formed when the winds of the two hot stars collide. Of particular importance in the sl FUSE UV range is the presence of a broad spread of emission lines with different ionization levels, ranging from Othinspace VI to Cthinspace III.  These lines are expected to arise in the bow shock zone at progressively larger distances from the X-ray heated bow head, as the compressed plasma flows outward along the shock cone and cools.  The study of how these lines vary with orbital phase in a selection of WCWO binaries will allow us to map out the structure and kinematics of the bow shock for a broad variety of systems.  This in turn will provide useful constraints on the basic parameters of the winds as well as the collision process itself.  The 5 systems proposed are known from optical data to show strong wind-wind collision effects.
B015|2| |DAVID|CRAMPTON|HIA, NRC of Canada|This is a continuation of a program assigned time in cycle 1.  Wepropose to obtain phase-resolved FUSE spectra of two supersoft X-ray binaries, achieving SN >10 over 1 - 2AA in orbital phase bins of leq0.1P.  The emission line features in the FUSE wavelength range cover a wide range of ionization giving a unique dataset for determination of the binary parameters, component masses, and disk structures which cannot be provided by optical and HST data.  The O VI lines may provide unique measures that define the stellar masses.  We will also use the combined data for each system to detect and measure high-velocity lines from bi-polar jets which are seen in the optical spectra of one system.  High-ionization lines from these jets are of particular interest since they are formed in the innermost region where the jets are undergoing their collimation and acceleration.  An improved understanding of jets has wide astrophysical implications.  
B016|2| |JOHN B.|HUTCHINGS|HIA, NRC of Canada|We propose to obtain binary-phase-resolved FUSE spectra of threeclassical X-ray binaries (Sco X-1, X1822-37, and LMC X-3) through their orbital cycles.  Each of these systems is the prototype of its type of system, and each has unsolved problems associated with it.  The optical and ultraviolet spectra of the first two are dominated by an accretion disk.  The third, LMC X-3, contains a luminous B supergiant, whose light is dominant in the visible, but opticalUV data also reveal the presence of a large accretion disk. FUSE data will allow study of these disks over a wide range of temperature and density, hence revealing physical properties of these accretion disks and kinematics of the gas.
B018|2| |JAMES|LEQUEUX|Observatoire de Paris|FUSE offers the unique possibility for obtaining far-UV spectra in thedirection of giant HII regions in nearby galaxies. The ionizing star cluster is a far-UV source, and the interstellar matter in front will produce absorption lines of H, H_2 and various atoms and ions. We will obtain the H_2H ratio, the HDH_2 ratio, the COH_2 ratio, the dustgas ratio as well as the abundances of various ions, and an integrated spectrum of the ionizing cluster which will be compared to our evolutionary models. We have already tested this technique by observing with FUSE the ionizing cluster of the blue compact galaxy I Zw 18. We wish to observe 8 targets having radial velocities differing by more than 130 km s^-1 from those of the Galactic interstellar gas.  For these targets, the lines will be well separated from the galactic absorption lines.
B022|2| |TRINH XUAN|THUAN|University of Virginia|Blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies are metal-deficient and thusconstitute excellent nearby laboratories for studying how the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies change with metallicity. Our sample consists of 4 BCDs chosen to span the metallicity range from 15 to 12 of the solar metallicity.  This sample will extend the metallicity range covered by our Cycle 1 observations (141 to 110 solar).  The proposed FUSE observations will allow us to investigate the 1) H_2 content of BCDs as a function of metallicity.  No H_2 line has been detected in the 2 very metal-deficient BCDs which have been observed by FUSE so far.  Will diffuse H_2 be present in more metal-rich BCDs and with less UV radiation density? 2) the structure of the ISM in BCDs. Analysis of 2 BCDs observed by FUSE in Cycle 1 (IZw18 and Mrk 59) show that in the first, the ISM appears to be relatively homogeneous while in the second, it is very clumpy.  What are the factors which determine the gas clumpiness in BCDs 3) the abundances in the ISM.  Analysis of the FUSE spectrum of Mrk 59 showed C, N, O, Si, Fe and S absorption lines which allow to derive abundances in the ISM using photoinization models.  How do these abundances compare with the abundances derived from the emission-line optical spectra? 4) the evolutionary history and stellar winds in BCDs by detecting the P Cygni profiles of high ionization S VI and O VI lines.
B023|2| |MARIO|PERINOTTO|Universita di Firenze|We propose to observe three central stars of planetary nebulae tostudy their winds, and perform a detailed atmospheric comparison.  Groundbased and IUE observations show these stars, A30, A78, and Lo-4, to be nearly identical in temperature, radius, and masss, although IUE spectra show very different wind characteristics.  The limitations of the previous UV observations, the lack of O IV and/or lack of O V 1371AA P Cyg, will be addressed with the FUSE observations.  We will perform detailed analysis of the photospheres and winds of these stars using the latest version of PHOENIX.  Finally, we will also include analyses of four similar stars for which IUE spectra are available but that are already FUSE targets PI targets NGC 1535, NGC 7094, and IC 3568, and the Cycle 1 GO target NGC 6210.
B025|2| |OLE|MARGGRAF|Universitat Bonn|The physical conditions in extended molecular clouds are still notwell known.  Most of our knowledge is based on CO emission, widely used to map the structure of molecular gas.  Since there is no H_2 emission available from the cold cores of molecular clouds, the H_2 abundance is usually calculated by linking it to that of CO.  Direct observation of H_2, the most abundant molecule in the universe, could provide information on the physical state in the core of a molecular cloud and on the spatial variation of this physical state over small scales.  We plan to observe a sample of seven sightlines towards the Galactic open cluster NGC6231.  The small angular separation of the target stars of overall 5.8arcmin will be used to examine the structure of the molecular interstellar medium down to scales of less than 0.3pc.  Physical parameters like abundances of H_2 and various metals, depletions, temperatures, electron densities, and the level of radiation will be determined and their spatial variation will be examined.
B027|2| |GIOVANNI|VLADILO|Osservatorio Astronomico di Trieste|The most abundant interstellar molecule, H_2, is associated with thepresence of dust which acts as a catalyst for molecule formation.  The abundance ratio of a refractory to a non-refractory element, such as the CrZn ratio, is a good diagnostic tool of interstellar dust content.  In Galactic interstellar clouds, high molecular fractions, f(H_2)equiv ,N(H_ 2 )N(HI)+2,N(H_ 2 ), are only found along sightlines of high Cr depletion, even though f(H_2) and CrZn do not show a linear correlation.  On the contrary a linear correlation between f( H_2) and CrZn has been discovered in high-redshift molecular clouds from the study of damped Lyalpha systems (DLAs) showing H_2 absorption Levshakov et al. 2000).  In order to contrast the properties of local galaxies with those of the high redshift galaxies associated with DLAs it is important to compare environments of similar metallicity.  The Magellanic Clouds (MCs), with their low metallicity, are ideally suited for this purpose. FUSE and ORFEUS have already allowed the measurement of H_2 along several MCs sightlines. Unfortunately, the CrZn ratio has been determined only for three MCs sightlines Roth & Blades, 1997), for none of which H_: 2 has been searched for.  We propose to use FUSE to measure H_2 along these three sightlines in order to compare molecular fraction versus dust content in the MCs, in the Milky Way and in DLAs.  In this way we expect to obtain fresh clues on the nature of DLA galaxies and on the interstellar medium of the MCs.
B029|2| |DAVID M.|MEYER|Northwestern University|We propose to obtain FUSE observations of the interstellar H_2 and CIabsorption toward six early-type stars in the core of the open star cluster chi Persei.  High-resolution optical observations of the interstellar Na I absorption toward these stars and others in the core of chi Per have revealed a rich variety of small-scale diffuse ISM structure in both the distant Perseus and more local Orion spiral arms.  At the approx. 1arcmin scales typically probed by these stars, this structure corresponds to respective physical length scales of 0.6 and 0.15 pc in the Perseus and Orion arm gas.  By comparing the abundances and excitation of H_2 and CI in these six closely-spaced chiPer sightlines, we plan to (1)investigate the possibility that the high-velocity NaI structure is associated with a density-wave shock interaction with gas on the inner edge of the Perseus arm, and (2)study the physical character of the small-scale Orion arm structure that seems to be evident not only in the NaI lines but also the lambda5797 diffuse interstellar band.
B030|2| |STEVEN R.|FEDERMAN|Univ. of Toledo|Interstellar clouds that give birth to stars are subsequently affectedby those stars.  In particular, massive stars, through their stellar winds, intense ultraviolet radiation, and their terminal supernovae explosions, contribute to the dispersal of the clouds and seed the clouds with newly synthesized elements.  In order to understand the details of cloud dispersal, on the one hand, and chemical evolution, on the other, in a site of star formation, the interstellar material toward stars in Cep OB2 will be probed through a study of absorption lines.  After three episodes of star formation, the material in front of Cep OB2 is all that remains of the original molecular cloud.  Analysis of H_2 absorption will yield information on the physical conditions for the material; gas temperature and incident ultraviolet flux will be extracted from the measurements.  These derived quantities will help constrain models of the evolution of interstellar clouds on Galactic scales.  A search for the F small I resonance line at 954 AA will establish the interstellar F abundance, which may be used to resolve the origin of this element is F synthesized primarily in Type II supernovae, whose effects should be revealed in a region of ongoing massive star formation, or in asymptotic giant branch stars
B032|2| |ROBERT|GRUENDL|University of Illinois|Planetary nebulae (PNe) are formed by the interaction between the faststellar wind and a previous slow wind.  In this interacting stellar wind model, the fast stellar wind which fills the PN interior is shocked and heated to X-ray-emitting temperatures.  On the other hand, ROSAT observations of 80 PNe show indications of emission from a 10^6K plasma in only 6 PNe.  Chandra has observed 3 of these PNe and 2 of them, BD+30^circ3639 and NGC,6543, have finally been resolved and show that hot gas fills their central cavities.  Thus, to date the presence of 10^6K hot gas has only been unambiguously detected in two PNe.  smallskip The deficit of detections of X-ray emission from PNe suggests that the PN interiors may have a lower temperature.  Heat conduction processes, and the mixing and evaporation of the cold dense nebular material into the hot interior will enhance the cooling rate and might account for the temperature drop of the PN interiors.  The determination of the physical structure and state of the hot gas in the PN interiors is necessary to address the details of the interaction of the winds (including the interface physics) in order to understand the physical structure and evolution of PNe.  smallskip We propose to observe the nebular absorption of OVI against the spectrum of the PN central star to probe the physical conditions of PN interiors.  Whereas the nebular absorption lines of CIV and NV can be produced by photoionization from the hot central star of PNe, the OVI lines offer a reliable diagnostic of the presence of sim3times10^5K gas for central stars as hot as 125,000K.  These lines can only be observed by FUSE.
B033|2| |GILLES|FONTAINE|Universite de Montreal|There are currently of the order of 15 hot B subdwarf (sdB) starswhich are known to exhibit low-amplitude (a few to tens of millimag), short-period (100-500 s), multiperiodic luminosity variations. These pulsations are thought to be driven by an opacity bump linked to the presence of a local enhancement of the iron abundance in the envelopes of sdB stars. Such an enhancement results quite naturally from the diffusive equilibrium between gravitational settling and radiative support in the stellar envelope. Nevertheless, surveys for pulsating sdB stars show that, in several instances, variable and non-variable objects with similar effective temperatures and gravities may coexist in the HR diagram. This result suggests that an additional parameter, perhaps a weak stellar wind, might affect the extent of the iron reservoir and thus the ability of the latter to drive pulsations in sdB stars. Fortunately, it is expected that such a wind might also leave its mark on the photospheric heavy element abundance patterns. The intended FUSE observations will i) permit a direct comparison of the heavy element abundance patterns in variable and nonvariable stars of similar atmospheric parameters; ii) provide a consistency check with our wind models; and iii) provide a test of the currently-favored explanation for the driving of the observed pulsations.
B034|2| |MARTINE|MOUCHET|Observatoire de Paris, Section de Meudon|We propose to observe the atypical Magnetic Cataclysmic Variable (MCV)AE,Aqr which is one of the few systems showing anomalous UV emission line ratios. The far-UV spectra will provide a crucial test on whether this system is characterized by peculiar ionization conditions or by anomalous non-solar abundances. The measurements of the resonance OVI emission line, combined with those of the NIII and CIII lines, will provide strong clues to discriminate between these different possibilities.  Other hallmarks of AE,Aqr are its extreme strong flaring activity, and a unique spectrum extending from TeV to radio wavelengths likely due to the propeller mechanism related to the fast magnetized white dwarf spin (33 sec). A total on-source exposure time of 40 ksec, will allow us to study the phase-resolved far-UV spectrum along the rotational and orbital (9.98 hr) periods in order to constrain the temperature and structure of the accretion-heated polar regions of the white dwarf. We will also observe for the first time far-UV flares which will provide further parametrization of the active regions thought to be produced by blob impacts at the magnetosphere.
B038|2| |CLAUDE|CATALA|Observatoire Midi-Pyrenees|Previous optical and UV (IUE & HST) observations have shown that theintermediate mass PMS Herbig AeBe stars possess strong stellar winds and dense chromospheres. These winds and chromospheres are the seat of active variable phenomena, most likely linked to surface magnetic fields. Detailed models of the outer atmospheres of these stars have been constructed, and predict that the Lybeta line at 1025 AA and the C III resonance line at 977 AA must appear with an intense emission component. We intend to check this prediction with FUSE observations, and take advantage of the observed fluxes and profiles to further constrain the models of these stars. In addition, we will also search for the presence of H_2 absorption bands between 950 and 1150 AA, which are expected if these stars are surrounded by massive accretion disks.
B039|2| |SUN|KWOK|University of Calgary|We propose to use FUSE to obtain high resolution spectra of 5planetary nebulae.  The FUSE spectral range contains lines from 3 different ionization stages of carbon, allowing for a much better determination of the ionization correction factors necessary for accurate abundance determination.  The carbon abundance in planetary nebulae is crucial in the testing of nucleosynthesis models and dredge-up theories on the AGB.  FUSE provides a unique opportunity to test these models.  We have chosen both type I and type II planetary nebulae for this study, as the latter group in particular are expected to have unusual abundances of the CNO elements.  The FUSE observations will also provide some data on the N and He abundances for these higher excitation nebulae.
B043|2| |JANET|WOOD|San Diego State University|VSge is an extremely unusual close binary.  Once thought to be relatedto CVs or LMXBs, it is now suggested to be a colliding wind system. If so, with its 12.3 hr period, it is the shortest orbital period colliding wind system known. It appears to be undergoing a short-lived phase of evolution, and may be in the very final stages of common envelope evolution.  VSge shows high and low photometric states, possibly related to its evolutionary state, in which the spectroscopic behaviour changes dramatically.  High resolution, phase-resolved UV spectra have been studied previously in the low state but no such observations exist for the high state and there are no published observations in the FUSE FUV wavelength range.  Still-unexplained phenomena occur in VSge which need to be investigated before the colliding wind model can be firmly established, including the mechanism causing the high and low states.  We speculate that this mechanism is related to a change in wind behaviour but this idea needs to be tested by observing and modeling the wind line profiles around the binary orbit in both states.  We therefore propose to obtain orbital phase-resolved FUSE spectra of VSge in two epochs.  With its rich spectrum of wind emission lines at a variety of abundances and ionization states, FUSE will allow us to model the structure and kinematics of the stellar winds and the shock front in the binary and probe a new regime of stellar wind collisions in evolved close binary systems.
B046|2| |JAMES|LAUROESCH|Northwestern University|Recent optical and radio studies have found convincing evidence forpervasive small-scale structure in the diffuse ISM on 10-10^4 AU scales.  The seemingly ubiquitous existence of such small, dense pockets of gas in the diffuse ISM is an important puzzle since the inferred over-pressures of these clumps imply lifetimes of only a few thousand years before they should diffuse away.  Measurements and comparisons of the interstellar absorption line profiles towards members of resolvable binary star systems with FUSE can greatly expand our knowledge of the physical conditions and abundances in these clumps.  Therefore, we propose to obtain FUSE observations of the interstellar H_2 absorption lines towards six members of three multiple star systems of varying separations with the goal of deriving accurate densities, temperatures, and radiation fields for the clouds associated with the observed small-scale structures in these sightlines.  By using the many lines of H_2, we can determine if these clumps are indeed as dense as they appear and discriminate between competing models for the origin of these features.
B047|2| |PAULA|SZKODY|University of Washington|We will observe the far UV emission of the highest field (230 MG)magnetic cataclysmic variable AR UMa and of the typical field (30 MG) polar VV Pup in order to confront theories of buried shocks and accretion heating.  A measurement of the far-UV flux in AR UMa will help to resolve ambiguities in our HST data about the field strength and the heating of the white dwarf under extreme field conditions.  In VV Pup, the ability to directly view the white dwarf, combined with a simple geometry where the primary pole rotates behind the white dwarf for part of its short orbital period, allows a clear separation of the contributions of the unheatedheated white dwarf and the accretion funnel.  The high resolution and large excitation range of lines covered by FUSE allows the delineation of the composition, temperature, density and velocity of the line-forming regions in the accretion funnel and at the photosphere of the white dwarf. The analysis of FUSE data on the 2 very different systems AR UMa and VV Pup will provide a clearer understanding of the conditions of magnetic accretion and their ultimate effect on the underlying white dwarf.
B048|2| |PAULA|SZKODY|University of Washington|The SW Sex stars are a subgroup of cataclysmic variables that areknown for several peculiar features, including high excitation single-peaked lines in their spectra, absorption features in the low excitation lines, phase offsets between the radial velocity curves and photometric eclipse times, unusual high velocity components, and orbital periods between 3-4 hrs.  The cause of these peculiarities is controversial, with possibilities ranging from mass transfer stream impact and overflow at high mass transfer rates to magnetic propellers, winds and jets.  As many of these suggestions depend on the inclination of the system, we propose to confront such theories by contrasting FUSE observations of the low inclination SW Sex star LS Peg and a more typical high inclination system DW UMa. The high quality, high resolution FUSE spectra we will obtain will allow us to construct detailed models of the inner accretion disk and velocity flows of both systems. This will resolve which of the properties are geometry dependent, and thereby lead to a basic advance in our understanding of this class of objects and ultimately, of the general effects of high mass transfer in close binaries.
B050|2| |Dr. Harold|Weaver|Johns Hopkins University|We propose using FUSE to address two fundamental issues in cometary science - the nature of the X-ray, EUV, and FUV emissions from comets and the D/H ratio. We will use FUSE to make a sensitive search for line emission from O VI and other highly ionized species in a suitably bright comet (V <= 7) observed as a Target of Opportunity. The presence of these emissions at the predicted brightnesses would provide unambiguous evidence that charge exchange of solar wind ions with cometary neutrals is the dominant source of x-rays in comets. FUSE is the only observatory with sufficient spectral resolution and sensitivity to detect these faint line emissions. If the comet has V <= 5, we also propose searching for the Ly-beta lines of D and H, as the deuterium abundance is an important indicator of cometary formation conditions. Accurate determinations of the D/H ratio in many comets are needed to determine whether or not they could have supplied most of the water currently present on the Earth.
B051|2| |STEPHANE|VENNES|Australian National University|Our HST GHRS investigation of white dwarfs in the EUV-selected closebinaries EUVE J0720--317 (WD0718-316), EUVE J1016--053 (WD1013-050), and EUVE J2013+400 (WD2013+400) revealed photospheric abundances of helium and carbon much larger than measured in isolated white dwarfs with similar parameters. This peculiar abundance pattern bears the signature of diffusive equilibrium supplied by accretion from a close red dwarf companion. Additional evidence for the accretion scenario emerged with the discovery of V471 Tau-like EUV variability in EUVE J0720--317 and J1016--053, which suggests abundance inhomogeneities across the stellar surface.  We propose to obtain high quality FUSE spectra of these three binaries and secure abundance measurements of He, C, Si, P, and S.  The data will enable a study of the distinctive roles played by accretion and selective radiation pressure. Because selective radiation pressure on He and Si is inefficient, their abundance is determined by steady-state equilibrium between the accretion flow and downward diffusion and holds a ratio of log(SiHe)-3.7, while the abundance of C, P, and S should be determined by radiation pressure correlated with effective temperature.  We also propose to study the surface abundance pattern of the white dwarf in EUVE J0720--317 with a series of spectra resolving the rotation phase.  The data will also improve orbital parameters initially established in GHRS measurements.
B052|2| |MARTIN|BARSTOW|University of Leicester|We propose FUSE observations of a sample of central stars of oldplanetary nebulae to study the evolutionary link between them and the H-rich DADAO white dwarfs.  Analysis of the H Lyman and OVI resonance lines provides a unique determination of T_eff and log g for each star, taking into account the heavy element abundances, which are known to affect the temperature determination. We will measure detailed element abundances from the metal line strengths in the high resolution FUSE spectra. Importantly, FUSE gives us access to absorption lines of several species which cannot be studied in any other wavelength range. From this work, combined with observations of a smaller number of related PI targets, when they appear in the public archive, we will re-establish the temperature scale for these stars and compare their compositions with their supposed white dwarf descendants. A search for ongoing mass-loss will be carried out, looking for P-Cygni signatures in the CIII and OVI resonance lines. Evidence of current activity might explain the discrepancies often observed between the PN kinematic ages and the stellar evolutionary timescale.
B053|2| |MARTIN|BARSTOW|University of Leicester|We propose FUSE observations of a sample of DAO white dwarfs to studytheir relationship with the DAO central stars of planetary nebulae and the DA white dwarfs, where helium is not, or no longer, present.  We will analyse the H Lyman lines, providing a unique determination of T_eff and log g for each star, taking into account the heavy element abundances, which are expected to significantly affect the temperature determination.  These abundances will be determined from the heavy element lines detected in the high resolution FUSE spectra. This is particularly important for species which cannot be detected in any other wavelength range.  With the improved accuracy of self-consistent determinations of elemental abundances and T_eff we will be able to compare the compositions with the CSPN and DA white dwarfs.  With multiple exposures spread across several orbits, we will be able to use the strongest of the narrow metal lines detected to check for evidence of binarity.
B054|2| |FRANCOIS|WESEMAEL|Universite de Montreal|The hot B subdwarf (sdB) stars are low-mass, core-helium burningobjects located on the extreme horizontal branch; they are the progenitors of low-mass white dwarfs. Their effective temperatures range from 20,000 K to 50,000 K, and their hydrogen-rich atmospheres display significant abundance anomalies of helium and heavy elements for example, carbon is generally underabundant, and that deficiency appears to increase with increasing T_ eff; the nitrogen abundance remains nearly solar over the temperature range, while silicon appears moderately deficient below 30,000 K, but is strinkingly underabundant at higher temperature.  Previous studies of these abundance patterns suggest that downward gravitationnal settling and upward radiative forces play important role in determining the observed abundances, but also that weak stellar winds, with associated mass loss rates of the order of 10^ -15 -10^ -13 ,M_, yr ^ -1 , might thread the atmospheres of sdB stars. We propose to secure FUSE spectra of a dozen of these stars, with the specific aims of extracting abundances for a dozen chemical species, mapping the variation of the abundance of each element as a function of effective temperature, confronting the observed abundances with the predictions of the weak wind model, and investigating the self-consistency of that model. The analysis of superficial abundances in sdB stars provides us with a unique tool for the determination of the properties of the stellar winds present in those objects, despite the fact that these winds are too weak to be detected directly.
B055|2| |MATTHEW|BURLEIGH|University of Leicester|We will use FUSE to accurately determine the fundamental parameters(T_eff , log g, radius and mass) of a sample of white dwarfs in Sirius-type binary systems. Far-ultraviolet spectroscopy of the H Lyman series is the only means available to achieve this goal. We will then use the mass determinations to investigate the initial-to-final mass relation for white dwarf stars. In addition, Hipparcos provides us with well constrained parallaxes for many of the primaries in this sample. We will use this data, together with the parameters determined with FUSE, to retrieve the stellar masses and hence test the white dwarf mass-radius relation, in particular the high mass end. Finally, we will search for evidence of elements heavier than He in these stars photospheres and in the circumstellar environment, and determine their abundances. This proposal is complimentary to our Cycle 1 program (A054, PI Burleigh), in which we are observing 11 targets with T_eff >= 35,000K. We now seek time to observe those systems with cooler white dwarf secondaries, T_eff <= 35,000K.  We note that some of these systems have been resolved in our complimentary HSTWFPC2 UV-imaging program, and within a few years we will be able to derive astrometric masses for the white dwarfs in several cases.
B056|2| |JOEL|BREGMAN|University of Michigan|The most fundamental quantity needed to understand cooling flows inelliptical galaxies is the rate that gas cools from the hot million degree state to the warm ionized or neutral state.  In AO1, we measured this rate to be about an order of magnitude lower than the cooling flow prediction in two elliptical galaxies.  If generally true, this will lead to a major revision of the model, and here we propose observations to determine the cooling rates in a complete sample of nearby ellipticals.  Together with X-ray and optical observations, the FUSE data will determine which alternative models are at work, such as those where much of the gas is flowing outward rather than inward.
B058|2| |ROSARIO|GONZALEZ-RIESTR|INTA|KQ Pup is one of the most representative examples of the VV Cep binarysystems. It is an spectroscopic, non--eclipsing, binary with a period of 26.7 years. The UV spectrum is dominated by the continuum of the hot star (presumably B0V), with two types of lines superimposed on it narrow absorptions --with or without red emissions-- of singly ionized elements, and broad absorptions of resonance lines with a wide ionization range and of excited lines of doubly ionized metals. The orbit of the system is very eccentric, and therefore a strong enhancement of the interaction effects is expected associated to the periastron passage, which took place in May 1999.  Conjunction (M supergiant in front of the B star) will occur during the period covered by the FUSE Cycle 2. In this geometrical configuration we will able to see the side of the B star facing the M supergiant, as well as a signature of a possible eclipse (not observed so far) by the extended M--star atmosphere or by its inner wind. The FUSE data will provide a deeper insight into the nature of the hot star and a better determination of the complex geometry of the line forming regions.
B060|2| |EDWARD L.|FITZPATRICK|Villanova University|We request observing time with FUSE to obtain far-UV spectra of 5mid- to late B-type main sequence stars (BVs) in the Orion OB1 association. These data will be part of a comprehensive investigation of the ability of current model atmosphere calculations to reproduce the observed properties of the BVs, including the overall energy distributions and the detailed absorption line spectra.  This study will provide a benchmark and a reality check for studies of more exotic early-type objects, since the BVs are the hottest and most luminous stars whose atmospheres can be modeled with simple assumptions, such as LTE, plane-parallel geometry, and hydrostatic equilibrium.  The targets span a T_eff range of 11000--17000 K, a vsini range of nearly 400 km s^-1, are lightly reddened to minimize the impact of the ISM, and are located in a relatively small volume of space to minimize differential extinction effects.  The sample is large enough to allow general conclusions to be drawn and to distinguish individual peculiarities from general trends.  This program will produce a valuable archive of uniformly high quality far-UV spectra uncompromised by interstellar absorption and spanning a stellar temperature range within which the 900-1200 AA flux constitutes a significant fraction of the total emitted stellar energy and is extraordinarily sensitive to stellar atmosphere conditions.  These data will be ideal for evaluating the success of current stellar atmosphere calculations and examining the effect of rapid rotation on the far-UV energy distributions of the BV stars.
B062|2| |SMITA|MATHUR|The Ohio State University|We propose FUSE observations of two bright well-studied narrow-lineSeyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s), Akn 564 and NGC 4051, to determine the properties of the emission lines, absorption lines, and the continuum in the FUV region of this important class of AGNs. The FUV bridges an important gap between the UV and soft X-ray regions, both in terms of wavelength and in terms of ionization states of key elements in the emission and absorption-line regions.  The proposed observations will enable us to determine the physical conditions from a few to a few hundred Schwarzschild radii in two NLS1s and to compare these with the properties of other types of Seyfert 1s.
B063|2| |PATRICK|BOISSE|Ecole Normale SuperieureDEMIRM|We propose to extend our study of the very small scale structure inthe molecular, atomic and ionized phases of the interstellar medium initiated during cyle 1 to larger scales (l simeq 30 AU) by taking two additional spectra of the runaway O star HD 34078.  HD 34078 (AE Aur) moves at a transverse velocity of 103 kms (or 20 AU/yr); thus the 3 spectra which will be obtained during cycle 1 will allow us to sample adjacent lines of sight distant by simeq 10 and 15 AU at the cloud distance. The two spectra we propose to acquire during cycle 2 will allow to probe separations up to 30 AU and better characterize the column density fluctuations for a broad range of species, including H_2, HD, CO, CI, SI, SiII, CII, FeII ...  Presently, only the first cycle 1 spectrum has been taken. It is excellent (SN simeq 20 at 1100 AA); HD lines are clearly detected as well as many lines from highly excited levels of H_2 (v=1, J=0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and v=0, J=9). From the analysis of this superb spectrum, we find that prospects are extremely encouraging for i) detecting variations deltaNN as low as a few H_2 (J=0, 1, 2) or weaker, nearly optically thin lines and ii) performing a very detailed modelling of this line of sight and of the physical conditions in the foreground gas.
B066|2| |THOMAS M.|BROWN|NASA/GSFC|We propose FUSE observations of M87, the central giant ellipticalgalaxy of the Virgo Cluster.  These data will investigate two important questions in extragalactic astrophysics bullet What is the origin of the excess UV light in M87 bullet Can we detect the warm gas that should be present in galaxy cluster cooling flows The UV upturn phenomenon is a key indicator of age and abundance in elliptical galaxies.  It originates in a population of hot evolved stars that are only well-isolated in the far-UV. In quiescent elliptical galaxies, the UV optical flux ratio correlates strongly with the optically-determined metallicity of the cool stars.  However, the UV upturn in active galaxies is systematically bluer than one would expect from their optically-determined metallicities.  In the case of M87, its UV emission is four times greater than expected, although non-thermal emission from its active nucleus comprises only sim10 to this puzzle lies in the far-UV, where the diagnostics characterize the appropriate hot population.  In Cycle 1, we will obtain FUSE spectra of three quiescent ellipticals. Cycle 2 observations of M87 would explore the origins of the excess UV light in active ellipticals.  The Virgo Cluster contains the nearest X-ray bright cooling flow, which is centered on M87.  As the hot intracluster gas cools from sim 10^7K to sim 10^5K, it should emit strongly in the O 6 lambdalambda1032,1038 doublet.  Although X-ray observations provide strong evidence for the hot gas, the emission from the warm gas has not yet been detected in an intracluster cooling flow.  Our observations will provide an important test of the cooling flow interpretation, as they will be much more sensitive to the O 6 emission than was possible with earlier far-UV missions.
B067|2| |FREDERICK M.|WALTER|SUNY, Stony Brook|The UV spectra of the youngest cool stars, the classical T Tauristars, are dominated by emission lines of molecular hydrogen (H_2), yet within a few million years the H_2 lines fade and the spectra take on the characteristics of the solar chromosphere and transition region. We propose to obtain the FUV spectra of four low mass pre-main sequence stars to study the early evolution of the circumstellar material.  This sample fills in the observational gap between the T Tauri stars in the FUSE cycle 1 program and the ZAMS stars like AB Dor. We propose 4 targets 2 very young naked (diskless) T Tauri stars, one transition object with an inner hole in its circumstellar disk, and a classical T Tauri star.  We have (or will soon get) UV spectra of these stars with the HST, and one star is our XMM spectroscopic target.
B068|2| |GRAHAM|HARPER|University of Colorado|We propose a detailed analysis of the FUV photoionizing radiation thatprovides crucial input physics for mass loss studies, e.g.  observations of the flux below 1044AA will allow us to constrain the CaII/CaIII balance and make significant progress beyond previous optical studies on stellar mass-loss, and circumstellar photochemistry. In particular we seek to determine the relationship between the FUV radiation field and other more readily observable (archival HST or IUE) UV diagnostics. This will allow us to achieve our goal of empirically estimating the FUV radiation field for the vast majority of stars, which are too faint to be observed with FUSE, and to improve upon their uncertain mass-loss rates.  The HLybeta profile provides crucial information on the excitation and ionization of hydrogen. HLybeta also causes fluorescence at longer UV wavelengths. We hope to establish directly the relationship between HLybeta and the fluorescent emission in the UV.  We propose deep exposures of gammaCru (M3III), betaGru (M5III), and lambdaVel (K5Ib) that are well studied in other spectral regions and are important for the study of mass loss. These spectra will provide a valuable complement to the spectral-types and evolutionary phases of the GTO targets and our Cycle 1 target alphaTrA (K3II).  
B069|2| |HARRIET|DINERSTEIN|University of Texas at Austin|We propose to continue our Cycle 1 program of studying the Lyman andWerner bands of H_2, seen in absorption against the UV continua of planetary nebula central stars, which arise within neutral-molecular envelopes surrounding the ionized gas. These are the pump lines for a fluorescent cascade of near-infrared emission lines which are observed in many planetary nebulae.  By observing the UV lines we can probe the chemical and thermal structure of the envelopes, as well as measure molecular column densities and clarify the excitation processes for the infrared lines. In Cycle 1 we were granted time for three targets, one of which was successfully observed shortly before submission of this proposal. Although the data were not yet available for examination, similar target observed by the project team revealed a rich set of H_2 circumstellar absorption features, demonstrating the feasibility of our program.  FUSE spectra also include absorption features from atomic species such as O I and C II, which give rise to important far-infrared fine-structure cooling lines that likewise have been observed from planetary nebulae.  In Cycle 2, we add as a secondary goal a search for nebular components of the O VI 032, 1038 AA absorption lines, which trace the presence of hot shocked gas, in nebulae with anomalously strong optical recombination lines of ions of oxygen and nitrogen. This will test a plausible hypothesis for the origin of this anomaly.  
B070|2| |EDWARD|SION|Villanova University|The central accreting object in compact binaries and other accretingsystems is usually hidden from direct observation, enshrouded by optically thick accretion disks which are opaque to the radiation emitted by the central object as it accretes matter.  In the dwarf novae RX And, WZ Sagittae and VW Hydri the underlying white dwarf accreter is clearly exposed with HST in the far UV, during quiescence.  However, there is an unidentified second hot component in these systems.  Since the hot white dwarf photospheric continuum is turning down, the contribution from a hotter inner disk region/boundary layer, accretion belt, or corona will show up in the FUSE wavelength regime.  FUSE spectroscopy will deliver the following fundamental information: (1) delineation by profile shape and velocity, of lower temperature line formation regions associated with the rotating photosphere of the white dwarf from line formation region(s) of higher temperature ion species associated with a boundary layer/accretion belt (or putative hot corona?) still present surrounding the white dwarf; (2) white dwarf rotation rates, yielding critical information on the boundary layer temperature/structure and spinup of the white dwarfs by accretion; (3) detection of metal line profiles of the most abundant element, C, and also N in WZ Sagittae to test accretion versus dredgeup for the origin of carbon, and test physical mechanisms that control the flow of accreted elements and hence abundance changes (diffusion, mixing, dilution, dredeup and ongoing accretion during quiescence).
B071|2| |STEFAN I.B.|CARTLEDGE|Northwestern University|We propose to obtain FUSE observations of interstellar ionH1 and H_2absorption toward 10 stars observed by STIS as part of the ISM SNAP Survey, a Cycle 8 HST observing program. The ISM SNAP Survey was designed to produce a database of high quality, high resolution spectra from which gas-phase abundances for large portions of the Galaxy could be derived. Krypton and oxygen have been chosen during initial analysis as tracers of the amount of absorbing material along the various sightlines. The gas-phase oxygen and krypton abundances relative to total hydrogen column density have previously been shown with GHRS to be essentially constant in the local Milky Way. Further, krypton is a noble gas not expected to be depleted much into dust in the ISM. The ISM SNAP Survey has extended precision measurements of these elements to significantly higher column densities than GHRS. Intriguingly, several Survey sightlines have yielded anomalously high Kr 1/ O 1 and O 1/H 1 ratios. By measuring the total hydrogen column density along these 10 sightlines, it will be possible to better determine the nucleosynthetic and/or dust depletion implications of these anomalies.
B072|2| |THOMAS|AYRES|University of Colorado|FUSE exposures of five late-Fearly-G giants will probe fundamentalplasma dynamics in their hot magnetized outer atmospheres; as encoded in spectral line widths, Doppler shifts, broad components, asymmetries, and wind-induced circumstellar absorptions. The giants lie in or near the Rapid Braking Zone where moderate mass stars undergo a radical transformation of their coronal outer atmospheres.  We also will explore the even more extreme extension of the RBZ to higher masses two G0 supergiants in the so-called hybrid region where hot coronae mix freely with cool stellar winds.  FUSE \/ spectra of the key O~VI $\lambda$1032 and CIII lambda977 features will allow us to separate the influences of temperature and opacity on the super-rotational broadening of the RBZ subcoronal emissions; and will strongly complement an ongoing HST STIS (1150--3100 A) survey of late-type stars.  Our ultimate objective is to understand stellar magnetic activity; crucial to solar-terrestrial relations, the early evolution of solar system, and one face of a myriad of hydromagnetic phenomena that occur in many cosmic environments protostellar envelopes, neutron star magnetospheres, the accretion disks of cataclysmics, and those of AGN.  The dramatic, rapid magnetic evolution of the RBZ stars allows us to view many fundamental aspects of stellar activity---coronal structuring, heating, and angular momentum loss---from an entirely different perspective than afforded by the highly accessible---but singular---case of our Sun.  It is through these different perspectives that we can hope to gain new insights into the underlying physical processes.
B074|2| |JOHN|RAYMOND|CfA|Disk-instability models, which are usually invoked to explain theoutbursts of transient close binaries, predict that the gas in the quiescent disks of Dwarf Novae and X-ray Transients should be neutral.  In fact, if the reduced viscosity of the low state results from the disappearance of MHD turbulence as predicted by the Balbus-Hawley instability, the required ionization state is so low that the gas should be molecular.  There is currently no direct observational evidence for this.  We propose a spectroscopic observation of the Dwarf Nova SW UMa, in an attempt to detect the molecular hydrogen bands at 1060 and 1105 AA in the quiescent disk of this system.  H_2 band diagnostics could provide valuable information on the ionization fraction of the gas which is essential for determining the nature of viscosity in the disk.
B075|2| |JOHN|RAYMOND|CfA|We will attempt to measure the fraction of a shock waves energy thatgoes into cosmic rays.  The NE sector of the young SNR SN1006 shows strong non-thermal X-ray and gamma ray emission.  The Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope observed the pure Balmer line filament in the NW section of the young supernova remnant SN1006.  The observation demonstrated that the electrons and ions do not reach temperature equilibrium in this 2300 kms collisionless shock.  However, the NW section of SN1006 shows very little non-thermal emission at radio or X-ray wavelengths.  We propose to obtain the line widths, intensities and spatial brightness profiles of the O VI lines in sections of the NW and NE shock waves to compare the electron-ion and ion-ion temperature equilibration efficiencies in shocks with very strong and very weak non-thermal X-ray and radio emission.  If a substantial fraction of the energy dissipated in the shock goes into cosmic ray acceleration, the line profile in the NE shock will be narrower.
B077|2| |EDWARD F.|GUINAN|Villanova University|The distance to the LMC is crucial to calibrating the cosmic distancescale but remains controversial and uncertain despite the efforts of many investigators.  We have demonstrated that the analysis of eclipsing binaries (EBs) has the potential to resolve this controversy. Guinan et al. (1998, ApJ, 509, L21) and Fitzpatrick et al. (2000, BAAS, 196, 2806) analyzed ground- and space-based observations of HV2274 and HV982 and determined LMC distance moduli of V-M v circ 18.30 0.07mag and V-M v circ 8.32 0.10mag, respectively.  Such an excellent agreement demonstrates the potential of this method, and the suitability of EBs as accurate standard candles.  However, these are only results for two stars and the method must be verified with additional observations and extended wavelength coverage into the Far-UV where the stars strongly radiate. The primary goals of the FUSE observations are to secure accurate, definitive temperatures and interstellar extinctions to the target stars (Sp. Typ. O7-B2), whose energy maxima occurs in the FUSE spectral range. All of the targets have FOSSTIS spectrophotometry covering 1150--4820AA.  The FUSE observations will be combined with UVoptical spectrophotometry and with light and radial velocity data that will yield the radii, T_ eff, E(B-V), log g, and FeH of the stars.  The distances to the stars (and the LMC) are directly determined from their radii, temperatures and apparent brightnesses (flux received at Earth corrected for ISM extinction). The FUSE observations, when combined with our other datasets, will reduce the uncertainty of the LMC distance to better than 2-3%.
B078|2| |EDWARD F.|GUINAN|Villanova University|We propose to use FUSE to complete an in-depth study of the evolutionof the transition region and low corona of a solar-mass star throughout its main-sequence lifetime. This program is part of a comprehensive study of the Sun in Time across the electromagnetic spectrum. We have defined a homogeneous sample of single G0-5V stars with well-known rotation periods that are proxies of the Sun at different ages. We are studying the dynamics of the lower layers of the stellar atmospheres by investigating line shifts, line asymmetries, and line broadenings that we presume are related to chromospheric evaporation by high-energy processes identified in the overlying corona.  Emission measure and temperature analysis will allow us to obtain a complete -D atmospheric model of active regions that we will link to the previously obtained coronal X-ray data. We will infer transition region pressures through the powerful density-sensitive ratio of the Csc iii 977AA1176AA lines; this important diagnostic will be adequate to identify and model the relevant magnetic structures based on the solar analogy, and, together with our coronal X-ray (XMM, ROSAT, ASCA, SAX), EUV (EUVE), and TR (IUEHST) data, to infer the importance of coronal energy releases. Our FUSE investigation is central to the understanding of the evolution of magneto-dynamic atmospheric phenomena, and the associated high-energy emissions in the Sun and in solar-type stars. It also bears on the crucial question of the influence of the young Suns expected strong FUV emissions on the developing planetary system -- particularly on the erosion of Mars primitive atmosphere.  Coordinated contemporaneous observations (with XMM, Chandra, HST, optical photometers, partly from guaranteed time programs) are planned and will be organized.
B079|2| |BRAD|GIBSON|Swinburne University|We propose a direct observational test of the Local Group Infallhypothesis that the majority of High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs) are the extragalactic building blocks of the Local Group.  The line of sight to the Seyfert PG1011-040 fortuitously passes through HVC,246+39+125 in the Wannier Clouds, a collection of HVCs in the direction of the Local Group anti-barycenter.  The proposed FUSE Cycle2 observations will be used to constrain the metallicity and ionization properties of HVC,246+39+125, which in turn will reveal its local (higher metallicity) or extragalactic origin.  Unlike the HVCs currently under study by the FUSE PI Team (eg, Magellanic Stream, Complexes A, C, and M), HVC,246+39+125 is expected to lie at a distance >~ 400,kpc, be of low intrinsic metallicity, and reside in the M31--Milky Way filament predicted by the BlitzSpergel Local Group Infall model.  None of the Galactic HVCs being studied by the FUSE PI Team have these same a priori predictions, and thus our program provides a natural complement to the more general PI programs.
B081|2| |WILLIAM P.|BLAIR|Johns Hopkins University|We will use FUSE to obtain detailed information about the kinematics,resonance line scattering properties, and physical conditions of gas involved in the collision of the Cygnus Loop supernova blast wave with an interstellar cloud.  The region, known as XA, is located on the eastern side of the supernova remnant and a wealth of supporting information at optical, UV, and X--ray wavelengths is available.  High resolution line profiles for CIII lambda 977, NIII lambda 989.8, and OVI lambdalambda1032,1038 (and possibly many other lines) will be used to sort out the competing effects of turbulence, thermal instabilities, projection effects, and resonance line scattering at several key locations on and ahead of the core of the shocked cloud.  Investigating such interactions is of primary importance for understanding SNR evolution in a cloudy medium and for assessing the effectiveness of SNR shock waves in heating and mixing the ISM.
B082|2| |CYNTHIA|FRONING|Space Telescope Science Institute|Novalike cataclysmic variables (NL CVs) are high mass-transfer rate,disk-fed CVs.  The high mass flow rate keeps their disks in a steady state, making NLs among the simplest accreting systems to understand and excellent laboratories for the application of sophisticated accretion models.  FUSE is ideally suited to address one facet of accretion theory that remains poorly understood the structure and driving mechanism of accretion disk outflows. Outflows in CVs take the form of fast bipolar winds. The mechanism that drives the wind, the influence of disk and boundary layer photons andor shocks on the wind, and the thermal and ionization structure of the wind are not well known.  We propose to use FUSE to obtain orbital phase-resolved FUV spectra of UXUMa.  UXUMa is the brightest of the eclipsing NLs and observations of this system have driven much of the ground-breaking research on wind and accretion disk theory in CVs.  We will model the variations in the FUV wind line profiles over the binary orbit to characterize the structure and geometry of the wind and probe the link between the wind and the disk.  Modeling changes in the lines and continuum before, during, and after the eclipse will allow us to separate the relative contributions of the different FUV emitting (and absorbing) components in the binary---including the winds, disk, and boundary layer.  In addition to characterizing outflows, FUSE observations of UXUMa will facilitate modeling of the underlying accretion disk and the disk-boundary layer physics in cataclysmic variables.
B084|2| |DONALD G.|LUTTERMOSER|East Tennessee State University|We propose to use FUSE to probe the temperature-density structure ofthe shocked atmospheres of long-period variable (Mira-type) stars.  For the first time, FUSE gives us the capabilities to study the outer shocked region of the atmosphere using the hydrogen Lyman lines.  At 5 separate phases, we wish to obtain MDRS spectra of the Lyman series from Lybeta to the Lyman limit (1030AA --- 912AA) for the warm Mira star, SCar.  With these spectra, we will make comparisons (1) between Lyman flux (and possibly H_2 emission) variability and the variability in the UV emission lines and hydrogen Balmer lines using previously obtained HST HRS, IUE, and ground-based optical spectra at coincident phases to the FUSE observations to study the effect that the radiation field from the lower, hotter shocks (where Mg 2 and the Balmer lines form) have on the upper shocked region (where the Lyman lines form), and (2) to synthetic spectra from representative dynamic models we have generated.  These NLTE radiative transfer calculations have shown that the radiation field of the inner shocks dominate the ionization throughout the entire atmosphere.  The calculations also have shown that the Lyman emission lines form in the outer reaches of the atmosphere where the shocks are much weaker as they propagate outward.  This is the first time such a diagnostic has been measured for the outer atmosphere of these stars.  It also gives us a pioneering attempt to record the suspected strong FUV H_2 in emission.  Such an observation will have strong constraints on the atmospheric structure of the outer layers of these stars.  Finally, it is imperative to obtain fairly high dispersion (R approx 10,000) spectra of the Lyman lines in Miras, since these lines are fundamental in the understanding of the energy flow in their outer atmosphere, and of mass loss in this critical stage of a stars evolution.
B085|2| |K.-P.|CHENG|California State University, Fullerton|Ultraviolet observations of 2Andromedae with the Goddard HighResolution Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HSTGHRS) clearly reveal the existence of circumstellar gas as well as the interstellar gas along the line-of-sight toward this nearby star.  We also detected varying red-shifted CaII absorptions in our ground-based optical spectra, which we interpret as gaseous infall.  These variable CaII absorption features and the presence of circumstellar absorption from AlIII lambdalambda1854.716,1862.790 and excited fine-structure levels of FeII near 2600 AA in our HSTGHRS data of And are similar to those observed in the proto-planetary system candidate betaPictoris.  However, unlike betaPic, 2And has no detectable IR excess based on our previous IRAS survey of dust disks around nearby A stars.  The detection of gaseous infall with characteristics similar to betaPic in an apparently dust-free stellar system suggests that we should re-examine existing models that attempt to explain the gaseous infalls in betaPic with grazing comets or erosion from the surrounding extensive dust disk.  FUSE observations of 2 And will allow us to study the characteristics and origin of the circumstellar gas. Our results will provide insight into the link between the circumstellar gas and dust.
B086|2| |GEOFFREY|CLAYTON|Louisiana State University|Understanding interstellar dust and its role in the universe is veryimportant. Virtually all observations of astrophysical objects and their physical processes are affected by the presence of dust either within the system being studied or along its line of sight.  We propose a research program that will significantly improve our knowledge of dust properties, specifically those of small grains.  Such an advance has not been possible prior to the advent of FUSE and its unique capabilities the high far ultraviolet (FUV) throughput and the ability to resolve H_2 lines, combined with a well-characterized instrumental calibration.  We will derive FUV extinction curves for several types of sightlines which possess distinct signatures associated with the small grain population and whose mid-UV extinction curves reveal vastly differing amounts of intermediate-sized particles.  We will study sightlines in the Large Magellanic Cloud where very non-Galactic mid-ultraviolet extinction properties are seen.  A new analysis of the mid-ultraviolet extinction found a region near the supergiant shell LMC2 where the 2175 A bump is very weak. LMC sightlines inside and outside this region will be sampled with FUSE.  These data will be used to probe and constrain the properties of the small dust grains, such as abundance and size, and their connection to the very different environments observed.
B087|2| |JASON X.|PROCHASKA|Carnegie Observatories|One of the most exciting aspects of quasar absorption line studies isto test and constrain theories of galaxy formation and evolution.  A principal challenge to this quest is to obtain coincident knowledge of the physical properties of the absorbing gas and the host galaxies or large-scale structure.  We propose to analyze the physical properties e.g. metallicity, ionization state) of the z0.167 partial Lyman limit system towards PKS0405-12.  By synthesizing our investigation of the physical properties of this QAL system with the galaxy data we have obtained we will compose an unprecedented study of a low redshift QAL system.  FUSE observations are essential for an accurate HI column density of this system as well as measurements of its metallicity, ionization state, and relative abundances of C, S, Si, and Fe.  This detailed examination of a z sim 0 QAL system when combined with our knowledge of the absorbing galaxies will provide a benchmark for comparisons against high redshift systems, pose questions on the nature of halointragroup gas, and advance our understanding of OVI absorbers.  
B089|2| |DANIEL E.|WELTY|University of Chicago|We propose to obtain far-UV spectra of two stars in the SMC, as partof a detailed study of the interstellar medium in the Magellanic Clouds.  Together with optical andor near-UV spectra obtained at higher resolution and SN, these far-UV spectra will be used to determine accurate abundances, pressures, temperatures, densities, and radiation fields for both neutral and ionized clouds in the SMC and in the Galactic disk and halo.  Because of the low metallicity, low dust-to-gas ratios, and strong radiation fields in the SMC, the derived properties of the SMC clouds will provide valuable tests for theoretical models of interstellar clouds.  Determining detailed abundancesdepletions and physical conditions for diverse environments in our Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds will also aid in understanding the absorption-line systems seen toward distant QSOs.
B090|2| |MICHAEL|SHULL|University of Colorado|The fundamental physical and chemical processes at work in molecularclouds are key objects of FUSE science.  Preliminary results on h2 in the LMC, based on available PI Team data, suggest a reduced molecular fraction in the low-metallicity LMC gas.  Although this result provides the first direct evidence of a metallicity dependence in the formation rate of interstellar h2, the available FUSE targets do not sample the high-extinction regime where the correlation between E(B--V) and molecular fraction is strong.  Therefore, we cannot test whether the apparent reduction in molecular fraction is due to reduced formation rates, high radiative destruction rates, or selection effects. We propose observations of 7 LMC stars and 2 SMC stars with E(B--V) 0.20 -- 0.42, which will allow us to test cloud models that incorporate different assumptions about the formation rate of h2 as a function of metallicity. We will also obtain CO emission maps in these selected regions to assess the COh2 ratio in this gas.  As a key goal of FUSE h2 science, this test can be applied only to sight lines for which the variation of molecular fraction with extinction can be tightly controlled.
B091|2| |MICHAEL|JURA|University of California, Los Angeles|Giant planets are believed to form in the disks of gas and dustsurrounding young stars. However, CO surveys of dusty Vega-type stars have found little gas. In an effort to understand the dissipation of molecular gas in young debris disk systems, we propose to conduct a spectroscopic search for absorption in the Lyman and Werner series of H_2 surrounding the Vega-type stars sigma Her, HR 7188, HR 3314, alpha CrB and HR 4796. Observations of these absorption features with FUSE will provide an extremely sensitive test for the existence of circumstellar molecular gas. We have selected sources for study with the FUSE prime spectrograph which have not been reserved by the FUSE PI teams and 1) contain dusty debris disks indicative of youth. (2) lie within 100 pc of the sun. (At such close distances, the amount of interstellar gas should be minimal.) (3) emit enough ultraviolet photons to be useful to detect H_ 2 in absorption.
B094|2| |JON A.|MORSE|University of Colorado|We propose to obtain fuse far-UV spectroscopic observations of theshocked outer rim of the young, oxygen-rich supernova remnant N132D in the LMC. These data will be used to calibrate the relative contribution of OVI emission from the blastwave expanding into the ambient ISM in our previous fuse spectrum of the ejecta in N132D.  In addition, the fuse spectra will be combined with existing and proposed hst and chandra imaging and spectroscopic data to completely characterize the excitation of the outer blastwave.
B095|2| |Dr. Randy|Gladstone|Southwest Research Institute|We request 40ks of FUSE time to observe Mars twice during 2001 to search for H2 emissions that would provide an important constraint on photochemical models and the escape rate of hydrogen. The best times for observation are 30 degrees before and after opposition (on or about May 17 and July 8, 2001), when Mars is close to Earth (subtending 17'' and 20'', respectively). The best existing FUV spectrum of Mars has a poor SNR in the 90-100nm range where H2 Lyman and Werner band emissions are most easily detected. Other dayglow emissions, notably those due to H, O, Ar, and CO, are also expected in the FUSE 90-120nm range, and we will search for N2 bands as well. We will use state-of-the-art model martian atmospheres and photoelectron production and transport codes to simulate these airglow emissions and derive useful atomic and molecular abundances from the data.
B097|2| |PETER E.|DEWDNEY|National Research Council of Canada|As part of a high-resolution multiwavelength survey of interstellarmatter in the Galactic plane, we are investigating the physical state of cold diffuse interstellar matter traced by dust, HI self-absorption, and various molecular species.  An increasing body of evidence from our survey and others suggests that far-IR emission and H 1 self-absorption may trace a significant amount of molecular hydrogen which lacks traditional proxy tracers like ^12CO.  Far-UV spectroscopy of these clouds will provide the first direct measure of their molecular hydrogen content.  We have selected a set of stars with foreground dust but no detected CO emission to observe with FUSE.  All of these probe the molecular content of dusty diffuse environments, with some also sampling ionH1 self-absorption features.  Obtaining H_2 column densities for these clouds is essential for understanding their physical properties, structure, and evolution, as well as the larger role of the cold diffuse medium in star formation and the Galactic ecosystem.
B101|2| |PAUL|BARRETT|Space Telescope Science Institut|A long sought-after group of polars are those with high magnetic field>60 MG), because they may provide valuable clues to the structure and dynamics of accretion in strong magnetic fields and the evolution of CVs in general.  The discovery of several soft X-ray polars by ROSAT and their subsequent identification as high field polars supports the conclusion that the bremsstrahlung is suppressed at higher fields and cyclotron cooling predominates. We propose time-resolved FUV spectroscopy of high field polars to study their accretion kinematics, their high excitation lines (e.g. OVI, OIV, and SiIV), and the distribution of gas in the binary.  
B104|2| |KNOX|LONG|Space Telescope Science Institute|We propose to exploit the unique capabilities of it FUSE to monitorvariations in the wind-formed spectral lines of 3 luminous, low-inclination, cataclysmic variables (CVs). Our principal goal is to improve our understanding of the dynamics of accretion-disc winds.  We have previously used HST to investigate substantial and rapid (sim hours to minutes) variability in our target stars, BZ Cam, RW Sex and V603 Aql, and have demonstrated that their disc-outflows are highly structured.  We aim here to follow up our discoveries by securing FUSE time-series data. These observations will allow us to determine the relative roles of density and ionization state changes in the outflow and to search for spectroscopic signatures of stochastic small-scale structure and shocked gas.  By monitoring the temporal behavior of blue-ward extended absorption lines with a wide range of ionization potentials and excitation energies, we will track the changing physical conditions in the outflow. A new sophisticated Monte Carlo code will be used to calculate the ionization structure of and radiative transfer through CV winds. This will allow us to establish the wind geometry, kinematics and ionization state, both in a time-averaged sense and as a function of time.  Our FUSE observations will provide a legacy that will be fundamental to the development of dynamical models of accretion-disc-driven winds, permitting critical tests of recent hydrodynamic simulations of unstable, line-driven disc winds.
B105|2| |KAREN|LEIGHLY|The University of Oklahoma|Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are known to havecharacteristically different X-ray properties than Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) with broad optical lines.  The most promising explanation for this behavior is that NLS1s have a higher accretion rate with respect to Eddington.  This result is fundamental, since accretion is thought to be the ultimate power source for all AGN.  Our recent HST spectra from two NLS1s reveal unusual UV emission line properties.  The high-ionization lines are broad and strongly blueshifted, in contrast with the low-ionization lines which are narrow, centered at zero velocity, and symmetric.  The most plausible explanation is that the high-ionization lines are emitted by a wind and the low-ionization lines are emitted by a disk. Such models have been discussed previously, but our spectra provide perhaps the strongest evidence to support these models to date.  We now seek to understand the geometry and physical conditions in the wind.  The proposed FUSE observations of two NLS1s, 1H0707-495 and IRAS13224-3809, will allow us to examine the profile of the high ionization resonance line ionO6lambda1034.  This line is typically emitted in material with higher ionization parameter than the lines observed in our HST spectra and thus comparison of the O 6 and ion C 4 line profiles will allow us to distinguish between classes of models that do and do not predict ionization stratification.  These targets are particularly suited for this investigation since only a few objects are known that have high-ionization lines dominated by wind emission.  
B106|2| |JOEL|BREGMAN|University of Michigan|In spiral galaxies, supernovae dominate the energy input into the ISM,controlling the volumes of hot and cold gas, the pressure, and star formation itself. Previously, the heating rate was estimated from the supernova rate and the energy per supernova, the product of which is uncertain to half an order of magnitude. FUSE provides a direct, accurate, and independent measure of the heating rate because the shocked gas emits O 6 as it cools through the 3times10^5 K regime. With the large aperture, we propose to measure the ionO6 emission from spiral arm and interarm locations for 4 nearby normal galaxies. Ultimately, measurements of ionO6 may prove as important as studying ionH1 or molecular gas in spiral galaxies.
B107|2| |D. MICHAEL|CRENSHAW|Catholic University of America|More than half of all Seyfert 1 galaxies show intrinsic UV absorptionlines and X-ray warm absorbers.  The frequent occurrence of this phenomenon suggests that photoionized, warm absorbing gas is an important component of the nuclear structure of AGN.  To understand the nature and origin of this gas, we must know its location, physical conditions, and kinematics. By simultaneously monitoring the variability of the absorption at UV and X-ray wavelengths, we can determine the radial location, density, and ionization state of the absorbing gas and measure its evolution in ionization, column density, velocity, and coverage of the active nucleus. NGC 3783 is an ideal target for such a study due to its brightness, and its extremely variable absorption and rapid continuum variability in both the UV and the X-rays. FUSE is a crucial tool for our work since the high-order Lyman lines provide an accurate measure of the neutral hydrogen column, and the high-ionization sc Ovi lines provide a key link between the UV and X-ray absorbing gas.
B108|2| |RAVI|SANKRIT|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to use FUSE to observe ultraviolet emission spectra ofsupernova remnants (SNRs) in the Vela-Puppis region.  With its sensitivity to emission from extended sources, its spatial resolution and its particular wavelength coverage, FUSE is an excellent instrument for such a study.  The FUSE bandpass includes CIIIlambda977 and OVIlambdalambda1032,1038, which are strong lines in SNR shocks and trace low ionization and high ionization gas respectively.  The spectral resolution of FUSE will allow us to compare line profiles and study the kinematics of the post-shock flow.  Since the OVI doublet is well separated, we will be able to use the flux ratio between the lines to estimate the amount of resonance scattering present.  We will also be able to detect the presence of multiple components if they are sufficiently well separated in velocity space.  In addition to these strong lines, we expect that several lines such as SVIlambdalambda933,944 and NIIIlambda991 will provide additional constraint on models.
B109|2| |NILS|BERGVALL|Uppsala astronomical observatory|Deep galaxy surveys have indicated that luminous starburst dwarfs mayplay an important role in explaining the increasing star formation activity towards higher redshifts. The relatively low masses and high star formation efficiency of these galaxies allows for a significant leakage of Lyman continuum photons into intergalactic space. They may therefore play an major role in the reionization of the universe at early epochs. To assess the importance of these objects in this respect we want to use FUSE to study, as a first step, one local luminous blue compact galaxy with extreme starburst properties, Haro 11. When compared with similar galaxies, Haro 11 is remarkably devoid of HI. This may be understood if a major part of the ISM is ionized by the starburst or is in molecular form. We propose to use FUSE to measure the strength of the Lyman continuum break to estimate the amount of Ly-continuum photon leakage and seach for molecular absorption lines of diffusely distributed H_2 to determine or set upper limits of the column density.
B110|2| |KLAUS|WERNER|Universitat Tubingen|The very first attempt to measure the iron abundance of a hotH-deficient post-AGB star arrived at a surprising result. Based on the absence of Fe lines in a FUSE spectrum of the PG,1159-type central star of the planetary nebula K1-16 we could show that this object is Fe-deficient by a factor of at least 10--100.  The same might be true for two other PG1159 central stars with similar stellar parameters based on IUE spectra, but firm results have to be waited for until FUSE spectra are acquired (PI team targets). Here we propose to look for iron lines in the central star of Abell78, which is of spectral type WC-PG,1159, hence, it is an immediate progenitor of the PG,1159 stars. We intend to see if the Fe-deficiency can be traced back in evolution closer towards the AGB phase.  If this is the case then the Fe-deficiency might be caused by dust fractionation on the AGB, hence, it is caused by the same phenomenon which is responsible of the extreme Fe-deficiency found in some (H-rich) early post-AGB stars.
B112|2| |B-G|ANDERSSON|Johns Hopkins University|FUV radiation shortward of 1108 AA causes electronic excitations ofthe hydrogen molecule through the Lyman (B-X) and Werner (C-X) transitions.  The relaxation back to the electronic ground state gives rise to a rich fluorescent spectrum.  Under favorable conditions this spectrum can be observed.  We propose to observe this fluorescence at unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in the reflection nebula IC 63.  Earlier observations suffered from restricted wavelength coverage or lack of spectral and spatial resolution.  Although the results are in general agreement with theory, distinct discrepancies persist, most notably a shortfall in the absolute intensity of the fluorescent flux by a factor of 10, compared to theoretical models, in the FUSE wavelength range.  In order to provide a detailed test of existing models, we propose to acquire high quality data in three locations within the reflection nebula at different distances from the ionization front.  By observing several locations and comparing the strength of the fluorescence, we will also be able to address the transfer of the continuum radiation through the nebula.
B114|2| |EDWARD|MURPHY|University of Virginia|We propose to use fuse to search for ovi emission from hot, coolinggas in the halo of the well studied, edge-on spiral galaxy NGC891.  Our proposed search for ovi emission in the halo of NGC891 will allow us to determine the total mass of transition temperature cooling gas (Tsim3times10^5 K), the scale height of the ovi gas, and to compare the distribution of this transition temperature gas with hotter gas (Tsim3times10^6 K) as revealed by ROSAT.  We have selected 3 positions in the halo of NGC891 for exposures of 30 ksec each (90 ksec total).  One position is sim 2.25 kpc above the nucleus of the galaxy to search for hot material escaping from the bulge.  The remaining two positions are placed sim 1.5 and 2.5 kpc above an active star-forming region in the NE section of the disk.  A similar fuse Cycle 1 observation of the strongly-interacting edge-on spiral NGC 631 produced a detection of ovi emission in 20 ksec.  Since NGC 891 is not interacting with other large galaxies, it provides a better comparison with the halo properties of the Milky Way.
B119|2| |JAY B.|HOLBERG|University of Arizona|We propose a FUSE investigation of presence of spectral lines due tothe first and second ionization stages of carbon and nitrogen in the photospheres of hot DA white dwarfs.  In general, knowledge concerning the presence of N and C is available only for the hottest stars (T_eff > 35000 K), from the C IV 1550 AA) and N V (1240 AA) resonance lines.  In cooler DA stars, these lines are weakened and are difficult to observe, leaving few spectral lines longward of 1200 AA to indicate the presence of these important elements in the atmospheres of DA stars.  With FUSE, we will measure the presence of N and C using the strong N II, N III, C II, and C III lines in the FUSE band pass.  We will also use these lines to investigate and test models of the stratification of these heavy elements in the atmospheres of DA stars.
B120|2| |JAY B.|HOLBERG|University of Arizona|We propose FUSE observations of the interstellar lines of sight for aset of white dwarf stars.  For each of these stars, the full ionization state of interstellar hydrogen and helium has now been measured.  Using EUVE, we have determined the ionization fractions of H and He, and from STIS observations with HST, we have detailed knowledge of the velocity structure and composition for each of these lines of sight. We will use FUSE observations of these stars to complete our models of these unique lines of sight through the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) by measuring ground state and fine structure transitions of Ar I, C II, C III, N II and N III ions which occur in the FUSE band pass.
B122|2| |JEAN|DUPUIS|University of California, Berkeley|Ultramassive white dwarfs form a relatively large proportion of whitedwarfs discovered during recent extreme-ultraviolet surveys of the sky. Their exact origin is unknown but it is believed that some of them might be white dwarfs with an oxygen-neon core resulting from the evolution of single star with an initial mass between 8 ltappeq M ltappeq 11 msun. Another possibility is that these may be the result of the merger of two normal mass white dwarfs (Msim 0.6msun). The surface composition of ultramassive white dwarfs is likely to be sensitive to their formation scenario. We propose to observe 2 of the brightest known ultramassive white dwarfs with fuse to search for presence trace elements (mainly C, N, O, Si, S, P, and Fe). We plan on using non-LTE synthetic spectra of white dwarfs to model the profiles of Lyman lines and measure or set upper limits on abundances of trace elements with resonance lines in the fuse range. These sources are also excellent background sources to investigate the local interstellar medium and we plan on measuring column densities of detected interstellar absorption lines.
B126|2| |BRIAN|ESPEY|Space Telescope Science Institute|Symbiotic binaries are ideal objects to study the mechanism of stellarwind formation.  From analysis of the collision of the white dwarf and red giant winds, we can determine how the wind reacts to differences in stellar parameters.  This is vital to understanding the mechanism of wind formation and to testing line-driven wind theory.  Unlike massive binaries, the winds of a symbiotic system have very different characteristics -- the hot wind is very thin and fast, whereas the cool wind is slow and weakly ionized -- and hence they can be isolated spectroscopically.  In addition, the white dwarf secondary of the symbiotic systems provides a far-UV continuum source against which absorption from a broad range of ionization levels can be seen, ranging from molecular hydrogen surrounding the giant star to highly ionized material in the wind collision region.  Because of the high ionization lines arising in the hot and shocked gas, as well as the molecular and atomic absorption arising in the red giants extended atmosphere, phase-resolved spectra provide the unique tomographic information we require to improve our knowledge of these systems and how winds are generated and interact.  Based on our observations made during Cycle 1, we know that our proposal is technically feasible.
B127|2| |THEODORE|GULL|NASA/GSFC/LASP|Eta Carinae, when observed by FUSE during the Early ReleaseObservations (ERO), was found to have surprisingly bright far ultraviolet fluxes clear down to 920\AA. Eta Carinae is a very massive star nearing the end of its lifetime and has undergone episodic outbursts. Over the past few decades, Eta Carinae has brightened continuously with a 5.5-year modulation in the visible and X-rays. What is the cause of the variability? Is Eta Carinae a single star or a binary system? Based upon the periodic variability, the hardness of the X-ray spectrum, and now the large UV flux measured by FUSE, we strongly suspect that Eta Carinae has a hot companion with a fast, massive wind. A 40 M\odot star could easily be the secondary companion of the >100 M\odot primary. Neither current radial velocity measurements nor visible spectroscopy would detect it. The FUSE spectral region offers the best opportunity of direct detection. In Cycle 2, we propose to observe Eta Carinae once early and once late in the cycle to look for variations in the stellar continuum, in the stellar line profiles and in circumstellar line absorptions.
B128|2| |DERCK|MASSA|Raytheon ITSS|We propose to observe 10 BN, BC and normal B1 Ia supergiants in theLMC.  By matching normal and CNO peculiar stars, the stellar wind line data will enable us to determine the relative C, N and O abundances between the different groups.  Finally, by employing a simple model for the origin of the CNO enhancements, it will be possible to derive absolute abundances for all of the paired stars.  This information will enable us to address long standing questions concerning the origins of the BNBC phenomenon, and elucidate the latter stages of massive star evolution.  Because our analysis requires unsaturated wind lines, only FUSE can provide access to C, N and O wind lines.  Furthermore, all of these lines will be unsaturated only in stars near spectral type B1 Ia.
B129|2| |ROBIN|SHELTON|Johns Hopkins University|Currently there is no significant observation of the O VI flux fromthe Local Bubble.  Such an observation will be very important for understanding the conditions and history of the Local Bubble and similar bubbles in the local interstellar medium.  In this proposal, we describe a strategy for observing the Local Bubble, screening out other sources of flux, and minimizing the necessary spacecraft time spent on the guest observer investigation.  The observed O VI flux will be combined with the soft X-ray spectrum for this direction in order to create the high energy spectral signature of the Local Bubble.  The results will be compared with the average Local Bubble O VI column density in order to estimate the physical parameters of the hot gas.  They will also be used to test and highly constrain theories for the formation and evolution of the Local Bubble and to determine the gas phase abundance of oxygen in hot gas.  In addition, this observation will make it possible to determine the O VI flux from the halo.  The combined Local Bubble and halo flux has been measured for a direction several degrees from the proposed Local Bubble observation.  By subtracting the Local Bubble flux, the halo flux will be determined.
B130|2| |SARA R.|HEAP|NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center|We are currently using STIS and EUVE to obtain high-quality, far-UV(1160--1700AA ) and extreme-UV (60--760AA ) observations of three analogs of the early Sun. We now propose to obtain FUSE spectra of these three stars in order to obtain spectral coverage over the wavelength range, 60 -- 1700 AA.  We will perform a detailed non-LTE analysis of each star, which involves constructing a model photosphere and an empirical model chromosphere that can be used to extrapolate the emission to the Lyman continuum region.  Given a realistic flux distribution of the early Sun by proxy, we will then develop photochemical models of weakly reducing primitive atmospheres to determine the lifetime and photochemistry of methane (CH_4). In particular, we will estimate the concentration of CH_4 in the prebiotic atmosphere (sim 3.5 b.y. ago) and during the Late Archean 2.5-3.0 b.y. ago). We will use these results to determine whether methane would have been sufficiently abundant to help offset the reduced solar luminosity at that time.  We will also use our photochemical models to solve for the concentrations of greenhouse gases and important pre-biotic molecules.
B131|2| |CHARLES D.|KEYES|Space Telescope Science Institute|To study the accretion and outbursts in symbiotic systems, we haveorganized a multi-wavelength, target-of-opportunity (TOO) observing program including Chandra, XMM, HST, and the VLA.  XMM observations have been approved and proposed Chandra data will provide supporting high-resolution spectral coverage that will probe the hottest regions during an outburst.  XMM TOO observations have been approved for any of the targets on our list that go into outburst between July 2000 and at least December 2001 the XMM A01).  The XMM observations will provide UV and soft X-ray coverage at several times during an outburst.  The evolution of the X-ray and UV spectrum throughout the outburst will play a vital role in distinguishing between the outburst models currently in contention for describing the behavior of these outbursts.  Emission line strengths of the FUSE-band species, especially when combined with lines of the same species from the other spectral regions, will provide diagnostics of the colliding windshock region.  The high-resolution of FUSE-band absorption features will provide a unique opportunity to probe several aspects of the outburst material.  Note especially that FUSE provides important information for the analysis of the x-ray data as FUSE observations of HI absorption are at sufficiently high resolution to allow the separation of the interstellar component from the systemic component of the absorption.  
B134|2| |SARA R.|HEAP|NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center|We propose FUSE observations of a small set of OB stars in the SMC tosupplement the extensive sample being taken by the FUSE PI team.  The combined dataset will complete the coverage of representative OB stars at low metallicity.  We will then combine the resulting FUSE spectral atlas with our existing HST spectral atlas of the same stars to form a comprehensive UV spectral library (900 - 1700 AA) of massive stars in the SMC. We will use this library itemto determine the stellar content (e.g. metallicity, star-formation rate) of star-forming galaxies at high redshift; itemto determine the properties, particularly mass-loss rates and abundances, of massive stars at low metallicities.
C001|2| |BARRY|WELSH|University of California, Berkeley|We wish to observe high velocity atomic and molecular gas seen inabsorption towards two early-type stars lying behind the evolved Shajn 147 SNR. We shall compare the physical and chemical conditions of this disturbed medium with that recently found for the similarly evolved Monoceros Loop SNR and contrast conditions in both these SNRs with that found for the far younger Vela SNR. Topics of particular interest will be the range of ionization present in the high velocity gas clouds, their atomic gas phase abundances and the possibility of detecting high velocity molecular H_2 absorption associated with the expansion of the remnant.
C002|2| |PHILIP|MASSEY|Lowell Observatory| The Far Ultraviolet Explorer provides a fantastic means of advancingour understanding of the physical parameters of the most massive stars.  New ground-based optical data has identified a sample of hitherto unknown stars of the earliest spectral types in both Clouds.  UV observations with HST are underway, but FUSE data in the FUV provides a much needed complement.  With FUV data of O VI lambda 1032 we obtain a much more accurate measurement of stellar wind parameters, allowing us to reliably use the optical nitrogen lines as a independent check on effective temperature.  FUV observations of the Ar VI lambda 1000 and Ar VII lambda 1064 will provide additional constraints.  We will use the most sophisticated and comprehensive model atmosphere codes including the effects of NLTE line blanketing, stellar wind outflows and spherical extension to analyze the data.  Our analysis will constrain the radiative contributions by shocks in the wind, providing information about stellar wind ionization structure, and allowing good determinations of the stellar chemical compositions of the most massive stars in the Clouds.  We will also be in a unique position to analyze the interstellar spectrum, and, from our continuum models, determine the extinction from the FUV to the optical.  We already have outstanding optical and HSTSTIS data on the most interesting, hottest stars in the SMC and LMC, and with the data that FUSE can provide, we will have the full wavelength coverage needed to do a really comprehensive job.
C007|2| |HARRIET|DINERSTEIN|University of Texas, Austin| We propose to observe diffuse UV emission from electronically-excited H_2molecules and recombining O^+2 ions in planetary nebulae (PNs). The H_2 observations will complement our Cycle 1 and 2 programs of observing the Lyman and Werner H_2 resonance bands in absorption against the continua of the central stars.  In Cycle 3 we will observe the stage of the fluorescence process which immediately follows the photon absorptions, and in turn populates the upper levels of the widely-observed near-infrared transitions such as v1-0 S(1) 2.122 micron.  Our FUSE observations will help resolve the on-going controversy over whether photoexcitation (as opposed to shocks) is the main excitation mechanism for the near-infrared lines, test current models for the photoexcitation of H_2 in strong UV fields in general, and enable us to constrain the physical conditions and total mass of H_2 in PNs. If photoexcitation dominates, it is likely that most PNs contain large amounts (several tenths of a solar mass or more) of molecular material, in addition to the ionized gas and possible neutral atomic gas. We will also search for diffuse O II UV emission which is part of the recombination cascade of O^++. Recent studies have shown that optical O II lines belonging to the same radiative cascade are anomalously strong in some PNs, by factors of up to five; taken at face value, these line strengths indicate super-metal-rich abundances in many apparently ordinary PNs.  The reason for this anomaly is not understood, but it casts doubt on our present understanding of atomic processes and elemental abundances in nebulae. These proposed FUSE observations will test current calculations of the O II recombination spectrum and address this recalcitrant problem from a new perspective.
C008|2| |DONALD W.|HOARD|Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory| AM Canum Venaticorum is the prototype of the interacting binary white dwarf (IBWD) class of cataclysmic variable (CV).  Unlike normal CVs, in which the mass donor is a hydrogen-burning late main sequence star, the donor in an IBWD is a helium white dwarf (WD). Mass transfer and accretion play important roles in a wide range of astrophysical scenarios, and IBWDs provide the opportunity to study a unique, relatively unexplored form of mass transfer with implications for our understanding of degenerate matter and mass transfer in general.  We propose to observe AM CVn with FUSE to obtain far-UV spectra folded into multiple orbital phase bins.  We will achieve several scientific goals with this observation, including (1) obtaining the first far-UV spectrum of an IBWD, which will yield abundance and excitation information and provide far-UV constraints for the devlopment of IBWD accretion disk models; 2) via high spectral resolution and high SN, thoroughly and conclusively exploring the complex line profiles hinted at by past optical and near-UV studies; 3) assessing the presence, composition, temperature, etc., of possible circumbinary material, which has potentially important consequences for the secular evolution of CVs; and 4) investigating the physical structure of AM CVn with phase-resolved spectra as it rotates in its orbit -- such phase-resolved spectral studies of CVs in the optical and near-UV have been irreplaceable sources of structural information about these binary stars.  We will carry this forward to the far-UV with our FUSE observations of AM CVn.
C010|2| |JANET H.|WOOD|San Diego State University| Accretion disks are invoked to explain a host of astrophysical phenomena, from protostellar objects to AGN. And yet the mechanism allowing accretion disks to operate are completely unknown. This proposal seeks to observe the smoking gun signature of magnetically--driven viscosity in accretion disks. Magnetically--induced viscosity is a plausible and generally accepted hypothesis (for aesthetic reasons), but it is completely untested. Determining the cause of accretion disk viscosity is of major significance to all accretion--disk powered systems (e.g. CVs, X--ray binaries, AGN and protostellar disks). These data will also firmly establish the importance of magnetic fields in accretion disks. Because of its known flaring properites, we will observe the accretion disk in EM Cyg with FUSE simultaneously with our HST (STISFUV) and CHANDRA time which has already been allocated.  This will allow the unambiguous detection of accretion disk magnetic reconnection flares.  
C011|2| |NANCY REMAGE|EVANS|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory| A measured mass of a classical Cepheid provides a unique test of evolutionary calculations in evolved stars because it is combined with a precisely known luminosity. The quantitative understanding of Cepheids reinforces the key role they play in determining extragalactic distances.  IUE, HST, and Voyager observations have now made possible observational determination of masses for several Cepheids in binary systems.  A FUSE spectrum of the hot companion of the Cepheid S Mus A is the key to a significantly improved accuracy for the mass, which is particularly important because S Mus A is the Cepheid with the largest measured mass.  A  FUSE spectrum  is necessary because this wavelength range is particularly sensitive to temperature at the spectral type of the companion  (B3 V), and the high resolution of FUSE is required to correct  for the H_2 absorption accurately. The spectral type or temperature (and the mass inferred from it) will be combined with the orbital velocity amplitude of the companion from HST GHRS echelle spectra, and the orbital velocity amplitude of the Cepheid from the ground-based orbit to determine the mass of the Cepheid.  By including the FUSE  data, the uncertainty in the mass of the Cepheid will be reduced from the current value of 12 percent to 7 percent. This will make it the most accurate Cepheid mass currently available and provide the strongest constraint on evolutionary calculations.
C017|2| |FREDERICK M.|WALTER|SUNY Stony Brook| The UV spectra of the youngest cool stars, the classical T Tauri stars, aredominated by emission lines of molecular hydrogen (H_2), yet within a few million years the H_2 lines fade and the spectra take on the characteristics of the solar chromosphere and transition region.  By the end of AO2, spectra of five T Tauri stars and of a few zero-age main sequence stars will be in the FUSE archives.  Here we propose to obtain spectra of two low mass pre-main sequence stars to study the earliest evolution of the stellar transition regions, and to look for residual fluoresced circumstellar gas. The targets are naked or weak T Tauri stars, with ages of 10^6 years but no evidence for circumstellar material.  This sample fills the observational gap between the T Tauri stars and the ZAMS stars like AB Dor. We have far-UV and X-ray spectra of these stars, and will use these together with the FUSE spectra to examine the atmosphere and circumstellar environments of the youngest non-accreting cool stars.
C019|2| |WILLIAM N.|BRANDT|The Pennsylvania State University|We propose two FUSE observations of the bright, nearby Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051. By studying the variability of the far-UV absorption lines, we aim to constrain the dynamical evolution, physical properties (density and ionization parameter), location, and extent of the absorbing gas. FUSE observations of the O VI 1032, 1038 A lines will bridge the gap in ionization potential between the current HST and Chandra spectra, enabling us to identify UV/X-ray absorption system counterparts. The C III 977 A line and higher-order Lyman lines (Lyman beta and up) will fill in key gaps in our understanding of the ionization properties of many of the UV absorption systems. NGC 4051 is an ideal candidate for this study and will serve as an archetype for characterizing the absorption in low-luminosity Seyferts.
C020|2| |STEFAN|DREIZLER|Universitat Tubingen| The recent discovery of radial and nonradial mode pulsations in more than 20 sdB stars make them primary targets for asteroseismology to probe their internal structure and discern their evolutionary status; the latter is crucial for reasons as diverse as understanding the late stages of stellar evolution and the calibration of the observed ultraviolet upturn in giant elliptical galaxies as an age indicator. Central to any asteroseismological study is an identification of the pulsation modes. Photometric studies have failed to identify modes from optical light curves.  Line profile and flux variations in the far ultraviolet offer a promising way to disentangle the pulsation modes by comparison with detailed model predictions. PG1605+072 is an outstanding target among the sdB variables because it displays the richest period spectrum (>50 pulsation periods), largest amplitudes and longest periods, which makes it the primary target for a spectroscopic FUV study.
C022|2| |GRAHAM M.|HARPER|University of Colorado at Boulder| One of the mysteries of Population II stars is that theystill show chromospheric emission despite their great age.  The global dynamo which was active during their main-sequence lifetimes is expected to become extremely weak through magnetic rotational braking. The nature of the observed emission is not understood; although acoustic shock waves might provide the heating, acoustic waves are not predicted to drive the observed mass loss - which in turn requires the dissipation of magnetohydrodynamic waves.  We propose to observe the stellar H Lyman beta emission wings and the fluorescent FeII and H_2 emission from one of the brightest, metal poor, Population II stars. These FUSE diagnostics, when combined with existing UV and optical spectra, will be used to determine the major radiative cooling channels and establish reliable chromospheric cooling rates.  These will then be compared to theoretical predictions from hydrodynamic models which have been proposed to generate the basal heating. By examining metal deficient stars we can extend the age-metallicity parameter space and provide a stringent test of the hypothesis that hydrodynamics alone is responsible for the observed chromospheric heating. The likely alternative is some combination of small-scale magnetic turbulence and acoustic shock heating.  This target will complement the spectra of the mildly metal deficient giant alpha Boo and will be a invaluable and unique addition to the FUSE Archive.
C023|2| |GRAHAM M.|HARPER|University of Colorado| We propose a detailed analysis of the FUV photoionizing radiation that provides crucial input physics for mass loss studies, e.g. observations of the flux below 1044 A will allow us to constrain the CaII CaIII balance and make significant progress beyond previous optical studies on stellar mass loss, and circumstellar photochemistry. Our targets provide the spectral-type coverage required to unravel the  CaII CaIII balance as the mass-loss rates increase by over three orders of magnitude from K5III to M5III.  We also seek to determine the relationship between the FUV radiation field and other more abundant (e.g., archival HST or IUE) UV diagnostics. This will allow us to achieve our goal of empirically estimating the FUV radiation field for the vast majority of stars which are too faint to be observed with FUSE, and to improve upon their uncertain mass-loss rates.  The H Ly beta profile provides crucial information on the excitation and ionization of hydrogen. H Ly beta also causes fluorescence at longer UV wavelengths. We hope to establish directly the relationship between H Ly beta and the fluorescent emission in the UV.  We propose deep exposures of beta Gru (M4.5III), beta Peg (M2.5II-III), alpha Cet (M1.5III), beta And (M0III) and lambda Vel (K4Ib) that are well studied in other spectral regions and are important for the study of mass loss. These spectra will provide a valuable complement to the spectral types and evolutionary phases of the GTO targets and our Cycle 1 and 2 targets.
C026|2| |THIERRY|LANZ|University of Maryland| We propose FUSE observations of three key white dwarfs having hybridhelium and hydrogen spectra the DBA and DAB stars. These stars are relatively rare, but may hold the key for understanding the chemical evolution of white dwarf atmospheres along the cooling sequence, more particularly the so-called DB gap. One possible explanation for these white dwarfs with mixed atmospheres is convective dredge up, where convection mixes the hydrogen and helium layers. Potentially other elements such as carbon and nitrogen may also be dredged up. Strong C and N lines are present in the FUSE band, and can serve as sensitive measures of the presence of these elements. Alternatively, some DAB stars have been found to be spectral composites consisting of DA and DB double degenerate binary systems.  The FUSE band is uniquely sensitive to the spectral energy distribution of stars in the 20,000 to 30,000 K range and will make it possible to distinguish two white dwarfs, even if their effective temperatures are similar. Other possible models, including interstellar accretion, stratified atmospheres and surface inhomogeneities, can be tested with FUSE spectroscopy.
C029|2| |JOHN|RAYMOND|CfA| Collisionless shock waves in interstellar plasmas heat different particle species todifferent temperatures, and they accelerate some particles into a non-thermal power law distribution.  UV and optical observations in the past few years have strongly constrained the ratios of electron, proton and heavy ion temperatures in a few SNRs.  We propose to measure the OVI emission line profile in the face-on shock near the center of the Cygnus Loop in order to constrain the kinetic temperature of oxygen and to constrain the fraction of shock energy going into cosmic rays.  Analysis of this 350-400 km shock is needed for comparison with the 2300 kms^-1 shock in SN1006 to explore the velocity dependence of thermal equilibration and cosmic ray acceleration.  
C030|2| |BASSEM M.|SABRA|University of Florida| We propose  FUSE observations of  the two nearby  radio-loud quasarsPKS2135-14  and  PKS2251+11  to search primarily for Ne+8 lambda 770, 780 associated absorption lines (AALs). These  two quasars lie at redshifts (z equals 0.2 and 0.3, respectively) which place Ne+8 lambda 770, 780 in the bandpass  of FUSE. Detection  of Ne+8 absorption, as well as  absorption in other high-ionization FUV lines, will  allow  us to  place  tighter  constraints  on the  total  column densities,  the overall  levels  of ionization,  and the  quasar--AAL relationship. We will use these data in conjunction with existing HST spectra to measure - constrain column densities of a wide range of ions, quantify the relationship to X-ray absorption, study the outflow dynamics, measure elemental abundances, and explore implications for galaxy evolution. The proposed observations will be essential contributions to a larger project involving HST spectra and images, new ground-based data, and X-ray observations with Chandra  and or XMM of these and other similar quasars.
C034|2| |GAGHIK|TOVMASSIAN|San Diego State University| We propose to observe the planetary nebula PNG135.9+55.9, whichwe recently discovered in the Galactic halo.  It is by far the most oxygen-poor planetary nebula known today, with an OH ratio about 1 to 500 of solar. The study of this extreme object is particularly important for probing the early chemical history of our galaxy, for studying the mixing processes in stellar interiors at extremely low metallicities, and for providing an independent determination of the pregalactic helium abundance. Our ground-based observations give an Ne to O abundance ratio of about 0.7, possibly indicating the occurence of unusual mixing mechanisms, and He to H of 0.074 +- 0.02. The proposed FUSE observations will allow us to determine the abundances of C and N, which are essential to understand the causes of the abundance pattern observed in this object. They will also allow us to put stringent limits upon the pregalactic helium abundance using a method radically different from that based upon metal-poor extragalactic HII regions.  
C036|2| |ROBERT A.|BENJAMIN|University of Wisconsin-Madison| We propose to obtain FUSE observations of one of the most unusualmolecular clouds known in the Galaxy (IVC 135+54-45 or IV21). This translucent molecular cloud is located in the low galactic halo, and is only one of three molecular clouds known to have a velocity not consistent with galactic rotation. It may arise from either vertical Galactic circulation or from extragalactic infall. Our observations will allow us for the first time to measure critical parameters for the cloud abundances, densities, pressures, and search for time-dependent effects in what must certainly be a dynamically evolving situation.  The information obtained here will allow us to link dynamical models of cloud infall to time-dependent chemical changes. These observations will serve as a useful comparison to studies of physical conditions in translucent clouds in the Galactic disk, and may allow us to  determine the distance to OVI bearing gas seen in this direction towards an extragalactic object.
C037|2| |ROBERT A.|BENJAMIN|University of Wisconsin| We propose to observe two objects, NGC 7714 and PG 1626+544, using theMDRS to obtain a high quality absorption spectrum of OVI while simultaneously using the LWRS to search for diffuse OVI emission from high velocity clouds.  Relatively brief exposures for these targets already show high column density, high velocity OVI absorption associated with the Magellanic Stream and complex C, respectively. They are thus the most likely directions for the detection of high-velocity OVI emission. The combination of the high quality OVI absorption spectra together with measurements of diffuse OVI emission will allow a direct measurement of the density and pressure in the interaction region and provide straightforward constraints on the density and velocity structure of the gaseous Galactic halo. This, in turn, will constrain models of mass, energy, and angular momentum loss for the Galactic interstellar medium. The absorption spectra will also be used to constrain the abundances in the Magellanic Stream and complexC.
C038|2| |THEODORE|SIMON|University of Hawaii| Main sequence A stars have a very shallow outer convection zone and are not expected to shine brightly in either UV chromospheric emission lines or coronal X rays.  Nonetheless, a small handful of early A stars were detected as strong sources of soft X rays during the ROSAT All Sky Survey, in some instances at luminosities above L_x > 1 x 10^30 erg s^-1.  In certain of these cases, the X-ray emission is suspected to come not from the A stars themselves, but from late-type companions, which were not resolved in the wide beam of ROSAT. We propose to test this hypothesis with UV spectra from FUSE in the wavelength region below Lyman alpha, where we can achieve high contrast between the chromospheric emission and the photospheric light of the primary. For a given measured X-ray flux, the C III 977 feature, in particular, is expected to be faint and narrow if a late-type dwarf is present, but strong and broad if the emission originates from the A star itself. A definitive answer can thus be obtained with very short snapshot exposures appropriate for a broad survey.
C041|2| |PAULA|SZKODY|University of Washington| While IUE and HST provide ideal information on the disks and white dwarfspresent in Cataclysmic Variables (CVs)in the temperature range of 10,000-20,000K, the importance of FUSE lies in its ability to study the hottest white dwarfs and the innermost areas of their surrounding accretion disks. This high temperature regime involves the higher accretion rate system that are located above the period gap at periods longer than 3 hours. For our study, we have chosen the two novalike systems V794 Aql and YY Dra for which IUE HST studies show hot white dwarfs or disks. V794 Aql does not show outbursts while YY Dra has a magnetic white dwarf and shows dwarf novae outbursts. A comparison of the disks, white dwarfs in these 2 systems with the low accretion rate dwarf nova system U Gem that FUSE observed in Cycle 1 will provide important constraints on the accretion limits for disk instability outbursts. We will use our BINSYN model code to confirm the hot temperature of the white dwarf in YY Dra and the disruption radius of its disk due to the magnetic field, and the high temperature and accretion rate for V794 Aql which lies above the limit for dwarf nova outbursts.
C043|2| |NANCY D.|MORRISON|The University of Toledo| The spectrum in the 1100--1187 A region of Deneb (Alpha Cyg, A2 Ia), the only star of its type observable by FUSE, will be recorded, along with that of a  comparison object with negligible mass loss, probably eta Leo (A0 Ib).  Deneb is  a massive star that is evolving toward the red supergiant phase and will finish  its life with a supernova explosion. In such stars, radiatively-driven mass loss  is sufficient to affect later evolution, yet our knowledge of their mass-loss  rates  is only approximate.  The observations will be analyzed by reference to a grid of spherical, expanding, non-LTE, metal-line-blanketed, unified model atmospheres. The ultraviolet spectrum of Deneb is heavily blanketed with absorption lines that are  Doppler shifted and broadened by virtue of being formed in the wind. While the  overall flux level will be sensitive to the input values of color excess and  effective temperature, the strengths and shapes of the spectral lines are expected to be sensitive to the mass-loss rate. In addition, the region to be observed contains the shifted resonance line FeIII lambda 1122, which will be  diagnostic of the ionization balance of Fe in the wind. Incorporating the FUSE spectrum into the model-atmosphere analysis will refine our understanding  of the outer atmosphere of this important object, better determine its mass-loss  rate, and constrain the theory of the evolution of massive stars.
C046|2| |JUDITH|PROVENCAL|University of Delaware| The key to understanding main sequence evolution is hidden in the detailedknowledge of the interiors of white dwarfs. We find structural differences among the two major groups of white dwarfs (hydrogen (DA) vs helium (DB) photospheres) that demand differences in origin not clearly understood by our current models.  Our conclusions concerning the differences between DAs and DBs rests on the asteroseismological models of GD358, the brightest known DB variable.  These models include 2 critical assumptions 1) an effective temperature of 25,000 K and 2) efficient convection.  These two assumptions are inseparably linked.  Small changes in temperature will result in changes in model convection zones.  Surprisingly, we do not know the temperature of any hot DB to within 1000 K.  GD358 itself gives two discordant results ranging from 25,000 to 27,000 K.  In addition, HST spectra of DBs reveal surprising detections of CII (1335 A) and a hydrogen abundance three orders of magnitude below expected limits.  We propose FUSE observations of GD358 and selected DBs to pin down the DB temperature scale and to investigate surface chemical compositions.
C048|2| |TIMOTHY|HECKMAN|Johns Hopkins University| Starbursts are a significant component of the present-day universe, andoffer unique laboratories for studying the processes that have regulated the formation and evolution of galaxies and the IGM.  We propose to use FUSE to obtain high-quality (SN 8) spectra of 5 powerful starbursts with complementary HST STIS long-slit spectra at longer UV wavelengths. When combined with  existing and scheduled STIS+FUSE observations of other starbursts, this sample will allow us to document the properties of the stellar population and interstellar medium in a representative sample that essentially spans the entire range in luminosity (10^8 to 10^12L_sun) and metallicity (0.02 to 2.5 times solar) seen in local and high-z starbursts. The FUSE data will be especially valuable to study 1) the coronal-phase gas that may dominate the energetics of starburst-driven superwinds, 2) the escape of ionizing radiation from starbursts,  3) the H_2 that fuels the star-formation, 4) the starburst dust-attenuation law in the unexplored FUV window, and 5) the stellar content of the starburst (thereby probing the IMF and burst history).
C049|2| |ANNE|PELLERIN|Universite Laval| We propose to observe two Seyfert 2 galaxies (NGC5135 and NGC1667)and one nuclear starburst galaxy (NGC2718) as part of a study on the starburst-AGN connection.  Recent studies has shown the presence of young stellar populations in Seyfert 2 galaxies, suggesting an evolutionary link between nuclear starbursts and AGNs.  With our new far-UV spectral evolutionary synthesis code, which make uses of a library of FUSE hot star spectra, we will characterize the young stellar populations observed in AGNs and nuclear starbursts.  The far-UV spectral range offers the possibility to directly study the wind signatures from hot stars, which are sensitive to the stellar temperature, luminosity class, and metallicity. The high spectral resolution of FUSE will allow us to collect accurate results on the physical properties of young stellar populations (age, metallicity, stellar masses, initial mass functions, and star formation rates). Combined with optical data these properties will allow us to establish direct links between nuclear starbursts and AGNs.
C050|2| |MATT|BURLEIGH|University of Leicester| We propose to observe the late-type B stars theta Hya and 16 Dra in order to spectroscopically resolve their hot white dwarf companions. Far-UV spectroscopy with Voyager I has already shown that the B star fluxes die at around 1000A, allowing us to observe the uncontaminated white dwarf spectra. These degenerates will have evolved from high mass progenitors and are expected to possess masses well in excess of the mean for white dwarfs in general. The increased sensitivity and resolution of FUSE will allow us to tightly constrain  the degenerate stars fundamental parameters (T_eff, log g and mass) through matching model atmospheres to the observed H Lyman absorption lines. These objects can then be used to investigate the high mass end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation and mass-radius relations.
C051|2| |WILLIAM P.|BLAIR|Johns Hopkins University| Very few examples of enriched debris from supernova explosions areavailable for observation in the far-UV, where unique ionization and chemical abundance diagnostics exist.  We propose here to study the kinematics and abundances of two oxygen-rich ejecta knots in the galactic supernova remnant Puppis A. Observations of the outer shell of Puppis A with HUT and in Cycle 2 with FUSE have demonstrated that, even with moderate foreground extinction, the filaments in Puppis A are accessible in the 900 - 1200 A region.  These will be the first FUV observations of the O-rich ejecta in Puppis A, and will constrain the abundances of carbon, neon, and possibly sulfur relative to oxygen. In particular, the abundance of C :O is an important diagnostic of the mass of the precursor star.  The high resolution of FUSE is crucial for assessing the impact of overlying absorption on the observed line intensities, and thus modeling the relative line strengths and abundances.
C052|2| |WILLIAM P.|BLAIR|Johns Hopkins University| We will observe a star behind the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant tostudy the line-of-sight interstellar medium structures toward and through this prototypical remnant.  In particular, a sdO star identified from Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope UV imaging lies behind the bright NE Cygnus Loop filaments and is the first UV background source known for the Cygnus Loop. We will observe this star as well as the directly adjacent optically-emitting filaments, making a combined emission-absorption line study of the region possible. These two nearly complementary ways of studying the same region will provide the most detailed look to date at the workings of the Cygnus Loop blast wave as it encounters an interstellar cloud.
C053|2| |MARTIN A.|BARSTOW|University of Leicester| We propose to observe a sample of cataclymic variables during the lowstate in their emission, to obtain direct far-UV spectra of the unobscured white dwarf components. From these spectra we will be able to systematically determine T_eff and g for each star and, in conjunction with the theoretical white dwarf mass-radius relation, obtain accurate measurements of their masses and radii. Many of our targets are double line spectroscopic binaries, providing K1, K2, gamma and i. Thus a knowledge of the primary mass will yield the secondary mass.  Systematic knowledge of the CV white dwarf mass distribution is essential for understanding the origin and evolution of CVs, determining whether or not they do pass through a period of common envelope evolution and considering the effects of past nova outbursts. In addition, we will use the FUSE spectra to search for photospheric heavy element absorption features from which we can measure element abundances. Of particular importance are the C and N abundance which can reveal an earlier phase of thermal-timescale accretion.
C055|2| |RAVI|SANKRIT|The Johns Hopkins University| Supernova remnants in the Magellanic Clouds have little foregroundextinction and can be observed in the ultraviolet.  We propose to use FUSE to observe the brightest optical LMC remnant - N49.  We will study the distribution and kinematics of the hot, O VI emitting component, and compare it with the lower ionization C III emitting gas.  The shock in N49 is impacting a molecular cloud in the southeast resulting in bright filaments.  In the west, the pre-shock medium has a lower density and the remnant is fainter.  Comparison of FUSE observations of the southeast, northwest and southwest regions will allow us to examine the global shock-ISM interaction and gain insight into how remnants affect their surroundings.  We also propose to examine a filament along the southeast rim at higher spectral resolution in order to more sharply constrain the shock properties in that region.
C056|2| |LUCIANA|BIANCHI|The Johns Hopkins University| We propose to observe with FUSE four Planetary Nebulaein the Small Magellanic Cloud, selected from a sample studied with HST UV and optical spectra.  The flux is dominated by nebular continuum emission in the HST UV range. Instead, the far-UV spectrum will provide a direct measurement of the stellar continuum, enabling a better estimate of stellar temperature and absolute luminosity, useful to refine  post-AGB evolution at low metallicity and nebular ionization modeling. The FUSE spectra will also contain several lines from the central star, that will provide accurate measurements of the wind terminal velocity and mass loss rate. These parameters are important to model the nebular dynamics, and to understand the central stars  properties and evolution. Theoretically,  the mass loss and several aspects of the post-AGB evolution strongly depend on metallicity,  and so does the yield of processed material. Therefore, it is very important to provide observational constraints in different environments. The proposed  SMC objects represent an extremely low metallicity case that can be observed by FUSE. We will compare results with similar objects observed by us in the Milky Way (Cycle 1) and in the LMC (Cycle 2), and with new detailed post-AGB calculations  (e.g. Marigo et al. 2001).  Additionally, the  H_2 transitions in the FUSE range  provide a powerful way to measure the circumstellar molecular gas, which - added to the mass of the central star, and of the ionized shell previously determined, will allow us to test theoretical initial-final mass relations.  The far-UV data will be a unique contribution to constrain the properties of these objects, which are effectively at a single, unambiguous distance.
C057|2| |EDWARD M.|MURPHY|University of Virginia| We propose to use FUSE to determine the extent and kinematics ofOVI emission from hot, cooling gas in the halo of the well studied, edge-on spiral galaxy NGC4631.  In FUSE Cycle 1 we obtained two 20 ksec exposures of NGC4631 that both clearly show OVI emission in the halo of the galaxy toward a ROSAT soft X-ray hotspot (NGC4631-A) and in the middle of an H-alpha feature (NGC4631-B) that has been interpreted as a chimney immediately below the hotspot.  We would like to obtain measurements along additional sightlines to determine if the hot OVI halo is broadly distributed or whether it is associated only with the localized outflow of hot gas from the chimney hotspot feature.  The observations should allow us to determine the total cooling rate of the halo gas which can be compared with the mechanical input energy from supernovae.  We should also be able to determine the scale height of the OVI gas and will compare the distribution and kinematics of this transition temperature gas with hotter gas T about 1-3x10^6 K) as revealed by ROSAT and Chandra.  We have selected 6 positions in the halo of NGC4631 for exposures of 20-40 ksec each (190 ksec total).
C058|2| |JOHN B.|HUTCHINGS|NRC of Canada| The brightest OB stars in more distant local group galaxies are reachablewith FUSE, and a few have been observed. This proposal is to increase the sample to include different locations within M33, to obtain a global comparison of the young stellar populations and ISM in the different galaxy environments. Our earlier work indicates that there are differences in stellar winds and the interstellar extinction and absorption that must relate to the star-formation histories of local group galaxies.
C060|2| |CYNTHIA|FRONING|Space Telescope Science Institute| AM CVn stars are double degenerate interacting binary systems inwhich a low mass (about 0.03 M_sun) white dwarf (WD) fills its Roche lobe and transfers mass to another WD via an accretion disk. They are characterized primarily by their helium-rich hydrogen-deficient) spectra, ultra-short orbital periods, and multiplicity of highly variable periodicities. The study of AM CVn stars allows us to probe an alternate, double common-envelope, route of binary evolution and test the influence of varying abundances and physical scales on the physics of accretion and outflows in disk-accreting systems.  We propose FUSE observations of the two brightest AM CVn stars, AM CVn itself and EC 15330--1403.  These objects are believed to be in a permanent outburst state  their accretion disks are hot, viscous, and in a steady-state.  Our goals are a) to isolate the relative contributions of the mass-accreting WD star and the accretion disk to the UV continuum;  b) to characterize the structure of the small, He-dominated disks;  and c) to solve the puzzle of the origin of the UV spectral lines and nature of the winds in AM CVn binaries.  With these results in hand we will be able to contrast the properties of more normal, H-dominated disk systems with those of AM CVn systems.
C063|2| |JOEL|BREGMAN|University of Michigan| Recent X-ray observations of the gas in galaxy clusters have failed to resolve the issue of whether cooling flows are present. However, our FUSE detections of OVI emission in several individual elliptical galaxies demonstrate the existence of cooling flows in these systems, which are cousins to the galaxy cluster cooling flows. The OVI doublet is a powerful diagnostic of gas that is cooling through the 10^5.5 K range, and here we propose to use it to determine if gas is cooling down from the ambient cluster temperature (T > 10^7.3 K) as predicted by the cooling flow model. Our strategy is to observe some of the nearest cooling flow clusters - two ordinary clusters that are representative of the class; and the Perseus cluster, which has the best X-ray evidence for a cooling flow. These observations will either confirm the presence of cluster cooling flows or rule out their existence once and for all.
C064|2| |JOEL|BREGMAN|University of Michigan| The cooling flow model of elliptical galaxies predicts the rate at which gascools from 10^7 K to a neutral or warm atomic phase, and as the gas passes through 3x10^5 K, it will produce OVI line emission.  This high luminosity OVI emission has now been detected by FUSE in an observation of the classic cooling flow elliptical NGC 4636, where the line emission implies a cooling rate of 0.4 M_sun yr^-1, the same as the value predicted from the model.  The model also predicts the inflow speed of the gas, which will be reflected in the line width.  We observe the OVI lines to be relatively narrow, already ruling out a variety of models, yet the analysis is compromised by spectral degradation due to the use of the large aperture when observing a diffuse object.  Therefore, we propose observations with the medium aperture that will accurately measure the line width and critically test whether the gas is flowing as predicted.  Furthermore, each inflow model has a distinct radial distribution, so our observations of the joint predictions of OVI line width and spatial distribution will be an extremely demanding test of the model.  
C067|2| |JEFFREY L.|LINSKY|University of Colorado| TW Hya will likely have the richest and best exposed far-UV spectrumof any member of the important class of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) because of its uniquely low extinction (A_v approx. 0.0), the face-on geometry of its disk that minimizes local extinction, absence of a local molecular cloud, and 50 pc distance (the closest for a CTTS). We request a deep exposure of TW Hya to improve the model for H_2 fluorescence (primarily by Lyman-alpha) as demonstrated by our analysis of the very rich H_2 emission line spectrum in the 1170-1600 A range seen in HSTSTIS echelle data. Since the FUSE band includes H_2 emission lines pumped from different rovibrational states in the ground electronic system, including much lower energy states than are sampled by STIS, we can study the population of rovibrational states within the ground electronic state, search for other fluorescent channels, infer the shape of the stellar Lyman-alpha line, study possible excitation mechanisms, and derive a lower limit for the amount of H_2 that is located in the stellar disk. In a short (2.1 ks) test spectrum of TW Hya the probable detection of the two H_2 emission lines demonstrates the feasibility of our program. The requested spectrum will also provide excellent profiles of the OVI emission lines that are needed to set upper limits on the amount of H_2 present in accretion columns andor outflows and to compare with models of line formation in accretion flows along magnetic flux tubes connecting the disk to polar magnetic starspots.
C068|2| |KNOX S.|LONG|Space Telescope Science Institute| Z Cam systems are disk-dominated cataclysmic variables. Unlike normaldwarf novae, which burst and then return to quiescence in a few days to a few weeks, Z Cam systems exhibit extended high states lasting several weeks to several months following some otherwise normal outbursts. In standstill, the disk is in a high mass transfer state, but the flux at visible and UV wavelengths is intermediate between outburst maximum and quiescence.  We propose to explore the physics of the standstill phenomenon with FUSE observations of a single Z Cam system, either Z Cam or EM Cyg, depending upon the behavior of the system during this FUSE Cycle.  We will attempt a fundamental test of the hypothesis that the mass transfer rate from the secondary is higher in the fainter standstill state than in outburst by obtaining FUSE spectra at all orbital phases in standstill and in outburst.  Access to the wavelength range below 200 A with a high resolution spectroscopic instrument is crucial to the success of such a test.  In addition, we will model the FUSE spectra to measure (at least differentially) the structure of the disk and the wind in outburst and standstill, determining the effects of disk luminosity on wind mass-loss rate.
C070|2| |ROBERT|OCONNELL|University of Virginia| We propose to use FUSE to study the spatial structure of the hot haloof the nearby spiral galaxy M101.  This is a large, face-on, Sc galaxy with bright OB associations distributed across its face, making it an ideal candidate for such a study.  We will search for O VI absorption from hot gas at five positions in M101 ranging in radii from 6 to 23 kpc.  These observations will allow us to study the large scale structure of a disk galaxy O VI halo for the first time.  Our results can be directly compared to O VI measures in the hot halo of the Milky Way.  In addition, the nearly face-on orientation of M101 will allow us to search for hot gas escaping from its disk, as is predicted by all galactic fountain models.  A direct detection of venting from the disk would provide crucial support to models of galactic fountains.  We have used far-UV images from the AstroUltraviolet Imaging Telescope to select five of the brightest star-forming regionsOB associations in M101 as background targets.
C072|2| |PARVIZ|GHAVAMIAN|Rutgers University| We propose a FUSE observation of a Balmer-dominated filament in theLMC supernova remnant DEM L 71.  We will combine the O VI emission line widths and fluxes with optical Fabry-Perot and Chandra data to estimate the shock velocity, as well as the degree of electron-ion and ion-ion equilibration.  This information will allow us to (1) construct evolutionary models of this supernova remnant, (2) study the physics of collisionless shock waves at intermediate (approx. 500 km per sec) speeds, and (3) complement FUSE data from a GTO observation targeting the X-ray bright, Fe-rich ejecta at the center of DEM L 71.
C073|2| |PATRICK|BOISSE|Ecole Normale SuperieureDEMIRM| We propose to extend our study of the very small scale structure inthe molecular, atomic and ionized phases of the interstellar medium initiated during cyle 1 and 2 to larger scales (l approx. 50 AU) by taking two additional spectra of the runaway O star HD 34078.  HD 34078 (AE Aur) moves at a transverse velocity of 103 kms (or 20 AUyr); thus the 3 spectra obtained during cycle 1 allow us to sample adjacent lines of sight distant by approx. 10 and 15 AU at the cloud distance. These spectra are excellent (SN approx. 20 at 1100 A); strong HD lines are clearly detected as well as many lines from highly excited levels of H_2 (v  0, J  11 as well as v  1, 2, 3).  A preliminary analysis indicates that i) prospects for detecting column density variations in H_2 J  0, 1, 2 (damped lines) are very encouraging (relative variations of 5 percent or better can be reached); ii) lines from the highly excited H_2 levels seem to vary in time and iii) the combination of the 3 observations provides, as expected, a very high quality spectrum.  The two additional spectra planned for cycle 2 (oct 2001 and feb 2002) will probe separations of up to 30 AU.  Our cycle 1 results provide a strong motivation for extending our search over larger scales by taking two other spectra during cycle 3. We will thus better characterize the column density fluctuations for a broad range of species, including H_2, HD, CO, CI, SiII, FeII etc and take advantage of the very high quality of the combined spectrum to perform a detailed modelling of the physical conditions in the foreground gas.  
C076|2| |J. CHRISTOPHER|HOWK|The Johns Hopkins University| We propose an experiment to measure the degree of variation in theGalactic hot ionized interstellar medium (ISM) over small angular 2.2 - 8.9 arcmin) and spatial (approx. < 2.6 - 10.3 pc) scales by observing OVI absorption towards four post-extreme horizontal branch post-EHB) stars in the globular cluster NGC 6752 (l,b)  (336 deg, 26 deg); d  4.0 kpc; z  -1.8 kpc.  Our analysis of FUSE observations of OB stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has revealed approx. 30 percent- 180 percent variations in the OVI column density in the Galactic halo over the approx. 0.5 deg- 2.0 deg separations between these targets.  This suggests the hot ISM is an extremely patchy medium.  In principle such measurements can limit the size scale of individual absorbing regions and yield information on the relationship between the hot and cooler phases of the ISM.  However, systematic difficulties in accurately determining the stellar continua for Population I OB stars limit the number of sight lines for which such measurements can be made.  Our proposed observations will yield high signal-to-noise approx. > 20 per 0.05 A resolution element) spectra of these four hot, post-EHB stars in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6752.  Because the stellar continua for these stars are very simple, we will be able to precisely measure the OVI column densities along these sight lines with (conservative) 1 sigma uncertainties of approx. < 10 percent.  We will use the proposed observations to study variations of other phases of the ISM in these directions, including the cold neutral medium traced by H_2 if present) and the warm neutral medium (e.g., using ArI).  The correlations (or lack thereof) in the total column density variations of these species will yield unique information on the relationships and interactions among the various phases of the ISM.
C078|2| |BRIAN|WOOD|University of Colorado| We propose to obtain the first observations of the Mira windaccretion system in the far-UV below 1200 A.  We will analyze C III and O VI emission lines formed in the accretion disk surrounding Miras companion star to better understand the physical properties of the accretion disk.  These lines may also contain wind absorption features that can be used to study the wind of Mira B.  Recent HSTSTIS observations revealed the presence of Lyman alpha fluoresced H_2 lines in the UV spectrum of Mira B, and we hope to detect additional H_2 lines in the FUSE bandpass to better understand the origin of this emission.
C079|2| |BRIAN|WOOD|University of Colorado| We propose to use FUSE to measure the O I and N I abundances in theLocal Interstellar Cloud (LIC).  We choose the white dwarf 40 Eri B as our target star because this is one of the few nearby stars that is hot enough to provide sufficient continuum emission to detect the LIC absorption against.  Furthermore, H I and D I column densities for that line of sight have already been measured from HST observations of 40 Eri A, which show only LIC absorption.  We will determine whether the OH and NH ratios in the LIC agree with previous measurements for much longer lines of sight.  These measurements show no evidence for variation but they individually pass through many clouds and will therefore miss variability on smaller size scales.  Knowledge of the OH and NH ratios and their variability within the LISM is important not only for understanding mixing processes in the ISM but also because of the possibility of deriving DH in the LISM by measuring DO andor DN and then multiplying by accepted OH andor NH ratios.  This removes the need to measure H I at all, which is difficult in many cases.
C081|2| |MICHAEL|SHULL|University of Colorado, Boulder| Both theory and modeling suggest that a substantial fraction oflow-redshift baryons reside in the intergalactic medium, associated with warm photoionized Lyman alpha absorbers. We propose FUSE studies to make quantitative measurements of the baryon content of a class of saturated Lyman alpha absorbers, with N_HI > 10^(13.5) cm^(-2), which probably dominate the baryon mass.  The Colorado IGM group just completed a Hubble GHRSSTIS survey of 201 Lyman alpha absorbers along 31 sightlines. In our STIS and earlier FOS surveys, we identified 3 promising sightlines (HE 1029-1401, MRC 2251-178, Ton 28) with 10 strong Lyman alpha absorbers, for FUSE studies of Lyman betaLyman gamma absorption.  These 10 new systems would greatly increase the current FUSE database (13 systems) of strong low-z absorbers.  FUSE observations of the higher Lyman lines will provide reliable measurements of their H I column density and doppler parameter, critical for precise measures of the baryon content and for accurate determinations (or limits) of their metallicity.  The observation of HE 1029-1401 allows us a chance to test the primordial nature of a Lyman alpha absorber in a cosmic void through its metallicity.  All sightlines also probe Galactic high velocity clouds and the Magellanic Stream.
C082|2| |JAMES|LAUROESCH|Northwestern University| We propose to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio FUSE observations ofthe interstellar F I 954 A absorption toward a sample of three stars HD 103779, HD 164816, and HD 190918).  The nucleosynthetic source(s) of fluorine are still a matter of debate -- the present day abundance of fluorine can potentially constrain models for pulsationally driven dredge-up in asymptotic giant branch stars.  An accurate measure for the depletion behavior of fluorine will determine whether it may be detectable in QSO absorption line systems -- an unambiguous detection of fluorine at suitably high redshifts would provide the best evidence to date for the neutrino process in massive stars.  Furthermore, due to its extreme reactivity, measurement of the gas-phase interstellar fluorine abundance is important for models of grain chemistry.  Despite the importance of measuring the interstellar fluorine abundance, only one previous detection has been made due to the low relative abundance of fluorine, the lack of lines outside the far-UV, and the blending of the available F I transitions with lines of H_2.  Examination of the far-UV spectra of the three stars in our sample shows they have relatively high far-UV fluxes at 954 A, as well as apparently no blending between H_2 absorption and the expected location of the strongest F I line.  These stars all have N(H) > 1.4x10^(21), yielding an expected F I equivalent width of > 10 mA (assuming the one depletion measurement is correct).
C083|2| |TERRANCEJ.|GAETZ|Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics| We will use FUSE to examine locations around the X-ray bright ringseen in the high resolution Chandra X-ray observations of the oxygen-rich supernova remnant 1E0102.2-7219.  Our three FUSE MDRS pointings will sample regions with differing distributions of OIIIf emission and X-ray emission (largely OVII and OVIII).  An additional off-target pointing will assess the continuum scattered from stars in the nearby HII region, allowing for a more reliable background subtraction.  The resulting detailed information about the distribution and kinematics of OVI relative to the other components will show whether the OVI contribution is associated more with the X-ray ring (an ionizing reverse shock) or with the OIIIf filamentation radiative shocks driven into denser ejecta).  Lastly, an enumeration of the mass contributions from the various ionization stages will allow a more reliable determination of the mass of oxygen in the remnant.  
C086|2| |STEVEN B.|KRAEMER|Catholic University of America| The Sd IV dwarf galaxy NGC 4395 is the nearest (d approx. 2.6 Mpc) andleast luminous (L_bol < 10^(41) ergs s^(-1)) example of a Seyfert 1 galaxy. This unique object possesses all of the classic Seyfert 1 properties in miniature, including broad and narrow emission lines, a non-stellar continuum, and highly variable X-ray emission, presumably powered by a small (10^(5) M_sun) black hole. Furthermore, there is evidence for blue-shifted, intrinsic absorption lines in the UV (C IV lambda lambda 1548.2, 1550.8), while X-ray spectra show the presence of bound-free edges from O VII and O VIII and evidence for even more highly ionized gas.  The UV absorption could arise within the X-ray absorbers or, alternatively, within the emission-line gas, which we have determined to have a high covering factor.  The unique capabilities of FUSE provide the means with which to constrain the ionization state, column density, and covering factor of the absorbers and, hence, distinguish between these two possibilities. By extending our investigation of intrinsic absorption to the low luminosity extreme of the Seyfert population, we will obtain crucial insight into the effects of luminosity, global covering factor, and central black hole mass on the intrinsic absorbers. A second goal of this project is to constrain the spectral energy distribution of the non-stellar continuum radiation, which may be unique in this object as a consequence of its small black hole mass.
C088|2| |ALAIN|LECAVELIER|Institut dAstrophysique de Paris, CNRS| The persistent non-detection of the products of cooling flows incluster cores at non-X-ray wavelenghts continues to be a major enigma. Recently, FUSE is reported to have been successfully used to detect the O VI doublet at 1032, 1038 A, from a cooling flow elliptical galaxy. This has provided a direct evidence for approx. 3x10^5 K ISM in this galaxy, in a quantity which is consistent with the cooling flow rate of approx. 0.4 M_sun yr^(-1) derived earlier from ROSAT observations. To search for the much needed similar evidence for massive cooling flows associated with rich clusters of galaxies, we propose here FUSE observations of five clusters whose abnormally large cooling flow rates (typically 400 M_sun yr^(-1), combined with low Galactic H I column densities in their directions and their relatively small distances make them promising targets. In order to develop a comprehensive understanding of these systems, a parallel programme of sensitive, aperture-synthesis imaging of these clusters at metre wavelengths is being undertaken, to search for aged population of relativistic electrons.
C090|2| |GERARD A.|KRISS|Space Telescope Science Institute| Photoionized, warm absorbing gas is an important component of thenuclear structure of AGN. About half of all low-z AGN show X-ray warm absorbers and high-ionization UV absorption lines, but the relationship of the X-ray absorber to the UV-absorbing gas is not clear. Only a handful of high-spectral-resolution observations with FUSE, HST, and Chandra currently exist (NGC4151, NGC3516, NGC3783, NGC5548, Mrk509).  These show a diversity of kinematic structure and ionization states in the absorbers.  Fewer still of these have simultaneous observations that avoid the uncertainties introduced by variability (NGC4151, NGC3783).  We propose to increase significantly the sample of low-redshift AGN studied at high spectral resolution in the X-ray and the UV by obtaining simultaneous FUSE, HST, and Chandra spectra of NGC7469 and Mrk279.  Both are bright AGN with O VI absorption resolved in recent FUSE observations. The new simultaneous observations will resolve the kinematics and ionization state of both the UV and X-ray absorbers.  This will permit a definitive assessment of their relationship and give clues to their location in the nuclear region.
C092|2| |D. MICHAEL|CRENSHAW|Catholic University of America| We will obtain simultaneous FUSE, HSTSTIS echelle, and ChandraHETGMEG spectra of the Seyfert 1 galaxies NGC 4151 and NGC 5548, to determine the physical conditions and abundances in their intrinsic UV and X-ray absorbers and place constraints on the unobservable EUV continuum radiation.  These observations are crucial for determining the structure and dynamics of the mass outflow in active galaxies and obtaining clues to its origin. NGC 4151 has an unusually high column of ionized gas, which may be related to our viewing angle relative to the the accretion disk and ionization bicone. The simultaneous observations of NGC 4151 are aimed at determining the physical conditions in the high-column X-ray absorber, which are currently unknown, and its connection to the UV absorbers. NGC 5548 has a more typical column of ionized gas, but efforts to understand the connection between its UV and X-ray absorbers have yielded conflicting results, due to variability and non-simultaneous observations.  FUSE provides the missing link between the UV and X-ray absorbers, because gives us the final pieces of information needed to fully determine their ionization states, column densities, abundances, covering factors, and kinematics.
C094|2| |ANDREW|SZENTGYORGYI|CfA| New Ne V lambda 3426 images of NGC 246 show a bright structuresurrounding a faint central region which is likely to be a hot bubble blown out by the luminous central star. FUSE measurements of Ne V lambda 1146 emission from the nebula are needed to establish the presence of the shock expected from the energetics of the fast stellar wind. FUSE O VI doublet measurements will determine to what extent swept-out material in the nebula reflects the Wolf-Rayet abundances of the central star.  We propose to observe spectra at two positions across the conduction front of the bubble.
C095|2| |RAJIB|GANGULY|The Pennsylvania State University| We propose to monitor the intrinsic O VI absorption complex towardRX J1230.8+0115. The complex consists of six absorbing structures spread out over 5000 km per sec. An existing STIS-E140M spectrum also shows these structures in Lyman alpha, N V, and C IV. Together with further STIS-E140M observations to be proposed in HST Cycle 11, we will measure changes in the equivalent widths of spectral profiles with time. In addition, we will measure the coverage fractions and column densities over a wide range of ionization species to not only decipher the underlying cause of variability, but also the physical conditions e.g., ionization parameter, density, metallicity) of the gas through detailed photoionization modelling. The two causes of time variability, bulk motion and ionization state changes of the absorbing gas, show markedly different signatures in the way high and low ionization lines vary.  The photoionization modelling will provide sizes which, when combined with the coverage fractions, will yield the geometry of the absorbing structures. These observations, the first for a complex of possibly intrinsic narrow absorption lines at low redshift, will test the hypothesis that the absorbers form as instabilities in the outflowing, relativistic wind.  
C096|2| |DAVID S.|FINLEY|Eureka Scientific, Inc.| This proposal seeks build on the existing FUSE observing programsrelated to DAO stars by including three additional targets that should significantly enhance the utility of the data set for measuring abundance variations with temperature and gravity.  In turn, those abundance measurements will be applied to ascertaining whether weak winds determine abundances in DAO, and how those winds vary with the stellar parameters.
C097|2| |REGINALD J.|DUFOUR|Rice University| HD 192163 is the Wolf-Rayet star associated with the emission nebulaNGC6888, the brightest of the WR shell nebulae.  The wind of the star has swept the circumstellar material, lost during the stars previous red supergiant phase, into a dense shell.  The shell has fractured, and the internal pressure of the bubble is now driving a 100 km s^(-1) shock into material external to the shell.  We propose to observe the Wolf-Rayet star with FUSE to examine the abundances in this external material.  In particular we are interested in the carbon abundance, which we will derive from absorption in lines of C III and C II.  Because the material is from the same source as the nitrogen-rich shell, we also expect considerable N III and N II absorption.  The proposed observation will also acquire the far UV spectrum of HD192163, which can be used to constrain stellar atmosphere models for the central star.  
C101|2| |MARTIN|GUERRERO|University of Illinois| Chandra observations of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 6543, the CatsEye Nebula, have unambiguously resolved diffuse X-ray emission resulting from the interaction of its fast stellar wind with the cool nebular shell.  The physical conditions of the shocked stellar wind in NGC 6543 should reflect the effects of heat conduction and mass evaporation at the interface with the nebular shell.  The observations show that the shocked wind has been cooled, but the abundances do not show evidence for mass evaporation from the nebular shell.  We propose to use FUSE to directly observe the nebular O VI emission lines, the dominant cooling lines from the gas at 3 x10^5 K in the interface region.  These observations will allow us to probe the location, content, and physical conditions of the gas at the interface, thus providing insight to the processes that control the physical conditions of the hot gas and drive the evolution of PNe.
C102|2| |EDWARD F.|GUINAN|Villanova University| We propose to use FUSE to complete an in-depth study of the evolution of thetransition region and low corona of a solar-mass star throughout its main-sequence lifetime. This program is part of a comprehensive study of the Sun in Time across the electromagnetic spectrum. We have defined a homogeneous sample of single G0-5 V stars with well-known rotation periods that are proxies of the Sun at different ages. So far we have observed three targets and have time approved in Cycle 2 for a fourth star. We are studying the dynamics and energetics of the lower layers of the atmospheres of these solar-like stars, and investigating the variations of the properties with age and rotation period. Emission measure and temperature analysis will allow us to obtain a complete 3-D atmospheric model of active regions that we will link to the previously obtained coronal X-ray data. Transition region electron densities are inferred through the well-established density-sensitive ratio of the C III 1176 A 977 A lines. This important diagnostic will be used to identify and model the relevant magnetic structures based on the solar analogy, and, together with our coronal X-ray (ROSAT, ASCA, XMM, Chandra), EUV (EUVE), and TR (IUEHST) data, to infer the importance of coronal energy releases. Our FUSE investigation is central to the understanding of the evolution of magneto-dynamic atmospheric phenomena, and the associated high-energy emissions in the Sun and in solar-type stars. It also bears on the crucial question of the influence of the young Suns strong FUV emissions on the developing planetary system - in particular on the photochemical and photoionization evolution (and possible erosion) of early planetary atmospheres and ionospheres. To this end, we are constructing spectral irradiance tables for the Sun at different ages for which the proposed FUSE observations fill a vital spectral and energy gap.
C103|2| |EDWARD F.|GUINAN|Villanova University| The distance to the LMC is crucial to calibrating the cosmic distancescale but remains controversial and uncertain despite the efforts of many investigators.  We have demonstrated that the analysis of eclipsing binaries (EBs) has the potential to resolve this controversy. Guinan et al. (1998) and Fitzpatrick et al. (2001) analyzed ground- and space-based observations of HV 2274 and HV 982 and determined LMC distance moduli of (V-M_v)_(circ)  18.30 plus minus 0.07 mag and (V-M_v)_(circ) 18.31 plus minus 0.10 mag, respectively.  Such an excellent agreement demonstrates the potential of this method, and the suitability of EBs as accurate standard candles.  However, these are only results for two stars and the method must be verified with additional observations and extended wavelength coverage into the Far-UV where the stars strongly radiate. The primary goals of the FUSE observations are to secure accurate, definitive temperatures and interstellar extinctions to the target stars Sp. Typ. O7-B2), whose energy maxima occurs in the FUSE spectral range. Four of the proposed targets have FOSSTIS spectrophotometry covering 1150-8000 A and observations are planned for the remaining two. The FUSE observations will be combined with UVoptical spectrophotometry and with light and radial velocity curves that will yield the masses, radii, T_eff, E(B-V), log g, and FeH of the stars. The distances to the stars (and the LMC) are directly determined from their radii, temperatures and apparent brightnesses flux received at Earth corrected for ISM extinction). When the FUSE observations of all of our program stars are available, and when combined with our other datasets, the uncertainty of the LMC distance will be reduced to better than 2-3 percent.  
C105|2| |MASSIMILIANO|BONAMENTE|University of Alabama in Huntsville| Many clusters of galaxies show substantial extreme-UV and soft X-rayemission in excess of that expected from the hot intracluster medium ICM).  The excess component can be explained by the presence of a substantial warm component (T  10^(5.5) - 10^6 K) of the ICM.  This gas reveals itself through absorption lines in the spectra of background QSOs.  The FUSE passband is ideally tuned for the detection of the O VI resonant doublet (lambda lambda 1032, 1038 in the rest frame) by clusters at low redshift.  We propose FUSE observations of three QSOs in the background of the Coma, A2244, and A1267 clusters respectively, to test for the presence of such warm gas.  Additionally we will also be able to use these observations to study hot gas in our own galaxy.  Recent FUSE observations reveal the presence of Galactic O VI emission towards the Coma and Virgo clusters. The proposed observations will further those studies towards a deeper understanding of the gas responsible for the emission.
C106|2| |THOMAS R.|AYRES|University of Colorado| Red giants represent the final stage in the life cycle of normalstars.  Those evolving from low-mass dwarfs like the Sun were magnetically active for most of their main sequence phase, thanks to a spin-catalyzed convective dynamo.  At the same time, such stars also experienced significant rotational braking by their coronal winds.  Once they expanded into red giants, their spins further plummeted, and they should have become magnetically dead; an expectation seemingly confirmed by a conspicuous lack of coronal X-ray detections.  However, reports of the deaths of red giant coronae were premature - far-UV C IV emissions (an important coronal proxy) have been detected in archetype members of the class by HST, and now O VI has been seen by FUSE in at least one case.  Curiously, however, features formed at similar temperatures -- Si IV and N V -- are absent, apparently removed by a mysterious cool absorber.  Our objective is to obtain additional detections of the O VI doublet in key red giants, to help address the question of the nature of the cool absorber, and the implications for smothering any coronal X-ray emission.  If we can show that there is lingering magnetic activity on the red giants, we might have found a possible link to the acceleration of their chromospheric winds, which chemically enrich the ISM and themselves are a long-standing astrophysical puzzle.
C107|2| |THOMAS R.|AYRES|University of Colorado| We propose a small survey of yellow giants to study the Fe XVIIIlambda 974 coronal forbidden line, discovered recently in several late-type stars by FUSE.  We selected candidate targets from an extensive HST STIS survey of the analogous Fe XXI lambda 1354 feature.  Active yellow giant stars (G0--G9 III) are the best choice, because their coronal emission measures narrowly peak at approx.  6x10^6 K, where Fe L-shell species -- such as Fe XVIII -- are most prominent.  Measurements of Doppler widths and shifts of the lambda 974 feature, at the high velocity resolution afforded by FUSE, will revolutionize the study of stellar coronal dynamics in ways that the current generation of orbiting X-ray observatories cannot.  A novel aspect of our program is use of the interstellar absorption feature in the adjacent bright C III lambda 977 emission core to calibrate the velocity scale.
C109|2| |DAVID V.|BOWEN|Princeton University| We propose searching for O VI absorption in the extended halo of theLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by observing the background AGN NGC 1672 (z 0.0045). The AGN lies 11.24 degrees from the center of the LMC, which corresponds to 9.7 kpc; this is 1.9 times the optical radius of the galaxy and just beyond the last determined H I measured from 21 cm emission lines, corresponding to a column density of N(H I)1x10^(19) cm^(-2).  Our science goals include determining whether a) the LMC is surrounded by a hot halo capable of causing O VI absorption at a radius of 10 kpc; b) the strength of the absorption is similar to that in the Galaxy, in the central regions of the LMC, or to high-redshift O VI systems; c) the O VI shows multicomponent structure caused by the two thin H I disks separated by 60 kms which comprise the galaxy; d) there are any other O VI lines at velocities different from the LMC or the Milky Way, which might be from Local Group intragroup gas.  We have also determined that two other fainter AGN lie only a few kpc on the plane of the sky from NGC 1672.  Probing the LMC halo on these scales would be invaluable for deriving the covering factor of the gas and small-scale variability in its physical condition. We seek 7 ksec exposures per object to establish if there is sufficient far-UV flux for future FUSE observations.
C110|2| |EDWARD|SION|Villanova University| The disk instability model predicts that the accretion rate of a dwarfnova should be vanishingly small during quiescence. However, the far UV spectra of many high accretion rate dwarf novae above the period gap have steeply rising FUV continua which require accretion rates at, or uncomfortably close, to the critical accretion limits such that dwarf nova outbursts would not be expected to occur by the disk instability mechanism. RU Peg contains what appears to be the hottest white dwarf yet found in a dwarf nova with T_eff  53,000K while SS Aur contains a 30,000K white dwarf and a Hubble FGS parallax indicating that the radius of the FUV emitting source is that of a white dwarf. There is also a second unidentified hot component in some dwarf novae which should show up in the FUSE range. Our proposed FUSE spectra will quantitatively answer what the correct fractional flux contributions of the accretion disk, white dwarf and other hot component(s) are to the FUV during quiescence, thus testing theoretical predictions of the disk instability model as well as yielding critical white dwarf surface temperatures, rotation rates, and chemical abundances.
C111|2| |ANDREA K.|DUPREE|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory| Hybrid stars form the critical link in the evolution of cool starsconnecting solar-corona-like objects with cool luminous stars, and documenting the evolution of magnetic structures. Three hybrid targets for FUSE can clearly illustrate atmospheric evolution for approx. 2 M_sun stars - gamma Dra (HD 164058), iota Aur (HD 31398), and mu UMa (HD 89758).  FUSE spectra can identify atmospheric extent (through fluorescent Fe II lines), energetics (with O VI emission and density diagnostics), and dynamics (through C III and O VI profiles) in this well-chosen sequence of 3 hybrid objects of similar mass yet different evolutionary stage.  FUSE spectra can define characteristics of these evolving atmospheres, determine the temperature and velocity profile of the wind, and provide observational benchmarks for theoretical models.
C113|2| |LUCIANA|BIANCHI|The Johns Hopkins University| Young massive clusters, which appear to be abundantly forming inmerging galaxies, but are not found in the Milky Way, provide the opportunity to study the conditions necessary for the formation of massive, compact stellar systems.  This insight into conditions present during the earliest epochs of galaxy formation, when ancient globular clusters (GC) are believed to have formed, helps constrain scenarios of galaxy formation and evolution.  We propose to observe three extremely young, UV-luminous star clusters in the Local Group spiral galaxy M33. These young, massive, and compact objects provide a key link to the young cluster systems in mergers, where our insight is currently limited, and these may be the only such counterparts which are accessible to the FUSE sensitivity.  The objects are selected from our previous extensive survey of M33 with HST WFPC2 imaging in 4 bands - U, B, V and far-UV (1700 A).  From multiband integrated photometry we determined age upper limits of a few million years for our target objects, by comparison with synthetic single-age population evolutionary models. Spectra in the FUSE range will provide precise ages for these objects, and unambiguously reveal their properties, by comparison with synthetic model spectra of extremely young single-stellar populations, and by the analysis of the strong spectral signatures that will reveal the massive star content.  The wind momentum and UV radiation flux from the massive stars will be compared with gravitational properties of each cluster (from mass estimates and light profiles), to assess whether such systems can survive internal dynamical evolution.
C114|2| |ALEXANDER|BROWN|University of Colorado| We propose FUSE (50 ksec) observations of the dMe flare star AD Leocoordinated with Chandra-HETGS (110 ksec requested AO3) X-ray spectroscopy to accurately measure for the first time the complete energy budget for coronal flares.  FUSE observations of the Fe XVIII 975 A coronal forbidden line are absolutely vital for determining the dynamical energy losses of the flares.  Changes in the C III and O VI resonance lines, formed in the transition region between 50,000 and 250,000 K, will also be recorded by FUSE.  Chandra HETGS spectra will be used to measure the temporal changes in the coronal emission measure, temperature, density, and elemental abundances, but are unlikely to be able to measure flare dynamics.  AD Leo is one of the brightest dMe stars in the FUV and X-ray regions and flaring rate data suggests that we should see about 10 moderate (factor of a few) and one large (factor of 10-20 enhancement) flares in a 30 hour observation.  We are submitting two very similar flare proposals, one for a single dMe flare star and the other for an active binary - our goal is to examine coronal dynamics for both situations and see how different they are.
C116|2| |JAY B.|HOLBERG|University of Arizona|We propose FUSE observations of the massive white dwarf Sirius B tomeasure its gravitational redshift and determine its surface gravity.  From these measurements we will obtain an accurate spectroscopic mass which can be directly compared to an improved astrometric mass for this key white dwarf.  A second goal of these observations is to independently measure the photometric radius of Sirius B in the FUV.  All of these measurements will permit testing of the theoretical mass-radius relations for degenerate stars to an unprecedented level of accuracy, approaching 1 percent.  A secondary science objective we will pursue with these data is a determination of the interstellar DH ratio for the Sirius line of sight.  We also propose FUSE observations of HD 74389B the only other known white dwarf, in addition to Sirius B, in a resolved binary system containing an A star. Please note:  During observation C1160104, the SiC channels sampled a region somewhere between the stars Sirius A and B and to have received light from both.  The SiC spectra for that observation should therefore be analyzed with caution.
C118|2| |EDWARD L.|FITZPATRICK|Villanova University| We request observing time with FUSE to obtain far-UV spectra of 11lightly reddened, mid-to-early B-type main sequence stars (BVs) located in the galactic halo.  These data, combined with complementary data from a Cycle 2 program, will be part of a comprehensive investigation of the ability of current model atmosphere calculations to reproduce the observed properties of the BVs, including the overall energy distributions and the detailed absorption line spectra.  This study will provide a benchmark and a reality check for studies of more exotic early-type objects, since the BVs are the hottest and most luminous stars whose atmospheres can be modeled with simplifying assumptions, such as LTE, plane-parallel geometry, and hydrostatic equilibrium.  Halo targets are chosen because the early-B stars in the galactic disk are either too bright to be observed by FUSE or too compromised by interstellar absorption to allow the stellar properties to be examined in detail.  This program --- which is essentially a survey of the best-observed halo BV stars --- will also allow us to address the issue of the normalcy and origin of these stars, and will provide a set of unreddened standard stars for extinction studies with FUSE data.
C123|2| |DIETER|REIMERS|Universitat Hamburg| We propose to study intergalactic HeII absorption over the redshiftrange 2.29 < z < 2.63 toward the QSO HS 1140+2711 from the Hamburg Bright Quasar Survey. HS1140+2711 was discovered in a FUSE Cycle 1 snapshot program, specifically designed to find additional extremely UV-bright QSOs for that purpose. With F_lambda approx. (3-5) times 10^(-15) erg s^(-1) cm^(-2) A^(-1) in the He II 304 A, forest, this target is nearly a factor of 2 brighter than HE 2347-4342.  Therefore, promises to dramatically increase the quality of information on the helium reionization epoch and on the ionizing sources of the IGM. With these new data, we will be able to observe the recovery in HeII opacity following the helium reionization epoch at z < 3. We will also measure the cosmic variance of mean He II opacity and use its fluctuations to understand the spatial density of ionization sources. With the high SN FUSE data, and combined with high-SN UVESVLT optical data, we expect to identify a major fraction of the He II Ly alpha lines with their H I Ly alpha counterparts. We will also be able to diagnose the nature of the ionizing sources from the optical-depth ratios, tau_HeII divided by tau_HI.
C126|2| |CAROL|GRADY|Eureka Scientific| Spectroscopic observations of Herbig AeBe stars haverevealed a wide range of stellar spectral energy distributions, solid state features in the IR, and a wealth of wind and infall signatures in the optical and UV. Combining these data with high spatial resolution, high dynamic range coronagraphic imagery suggests that distinctive features in the IR spectra may originate not in the disk but in an extended envelope which is expected to account for the IR photodissociation region features. The available UVFUV spectral data for some of the hotter Herbig Ae stars indicate that the envelope systems have enhanced neutral atomic and molecular gas in the line of sight compared to the disk-only systems. For cooler Herbig Ae stars, fluorescent H_2 emission should be enhanced in the envelope systems compared to the disk systems, and the line of sight H_2 can be probed using the lines overlying the O VI emission.  We propose testing this hypothesis with FUSE LWRS spectra of three Herbig Ae stars, with two stars chosen on the basis of their IR spectral features indicating the presence of envelopes, and one single star with a disk which shows no envelope features in the STIS coronagraphic imagery.
C127|2| |STEPHAN R.|MCCANDLISS|The Johns Hopkins University| We propose to acquire a comprehensive set of FUSE observations of thereflection nebula NGC 2023.  These data will allow us to form a complete picture of the far-UV pumping and subsequent fluorescent cascade within a dusty and UV intense environment where the formation of molecular hydrogen on grains and the strong radiation field may be influencing the ground state population distribution.  This study will be aided by existing low resolution longslit sounding rocket observations of the nebula and central star, from which we have derived a far-UV dust scattering model and which have provided intriguing hints of emission above the scattered light.  We will use infrared observations of the molecular hydrogen quadrupole emissions in NGC 2023 to guide our selection of pointings to uncover the far-UV fluorescent cascade within this reflection nebula.  The high spectral resolution of FUSE will allow us to easily distinguish the fluorescent emission from the nebular scattered light.  The results will provide useful constraints on models of photo-dissociation regions.
C128|2| |THOMAS M.|BROWN|STScI| The hot stars responsible for the UV upturn phenomenon are keyindicators of age and abundance for the stellar populations in ellipticals.  These stars are well-isolated in the FUSE wavelength range from the cooler main sequence stars that complicate interpretation at wavelengths longer than 2000 Angstroms.  The strength of the UV upturn correlates well with optical metallicity indices, but these optical indices trace abundances in the cool population, not the hot stars that produce the UV emission, so the relation between abundance and UV upturn remains unclear.  We are currently obtaining FUSE observations of two giant elliptical galaxies with strong UV emission NGC 4649 and NGC 1399.  For the next cycle, we propose complementary observations of two ellipticals with weak emission NGC 221 and NGC 4472.  Although NGC 221 is a fundamental testing ground for theories of stellar and galactic evolution, its spectrum has never been measured below Lyman alpha.  The galaxy is unique because it the closest and most metal-poor elliptical, with the weakest measured UV upturn.  NGC 4472 was observed by the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope, but at considerably lower signal-to-noise and resolution than possible with FUSE.  With FUSE data, the absorption lines of C, N, and Si prevalent in the far-UV will provide invaluable composition diagnostics for the hot stellar populations in ellipticals.  Furthermore, FUSE is uniquely qualified to measure the Lyman series, an important diagnostic of effective temperature and surface gravity.  FUSE presents the opportunity to understand the role of abundance in the UV upturn phenomenon.
C129|2| |THOMAS M.|BROWN|STScI| Subdwarf B stars in the Galactic field are the metal-rich counterpartsto the extreme horizontal branch stars found in globular clusters, and they are the dominant source of UV emission in old elliptical galaxies.  They are distinguished by their high effective temperature T_eff > 25,000 K) and surface gravity (log g > 5).  The sdB stars all show significant abundance anomalies most are extremely deficient in helium and heavy elements, but a minority are helium-rich.  Deficiencies in helium and heavy elements have been attributed to gravitational settling, but the helium-enriched members of the class present a puzzling exception, because radiative levitation should be too weak to prevent gravitational settling.  We hypothesize that these helium-rich sdB stars are the result of a delayed helium-core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve.  The convective zone produced by this flash will penetrate the hydrogen envelope, mixing hydrogen into the hot helium-burning interior, where is rapidly consumed.  The resulting star should show greatly enhanced helium and carbon with respect to the other heavy elements.  This phenomenon is analogous to the born again scenario for producing hydrogen-deficient R CrB stars following a very late helium-shell flash.  To test this hypothesis, we propose FUSE observations of three helium-rich sdB stars.  FUSE observations will provide the first far-UV spectra of this unusual class of stars.
C131|2| |CHARLES|HOOPES|Johns Hopkins University| Galactic scale superwinds from starbursts have an important impact onthe evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. However, the full extent of their influence is still in question, due to the lack of information on the coronal phase in the wind. Emission from this 10^5 - 10^6 K gas may dominate the cooling in the superwind, and thereby determine the evolution of the wind and its ability to deposit mass and energy into the intergalactic medium. We propose to observe O VI lambda lambda 1032, 1038 emission from the coronal gas in two prototypical starburst superwind galaxies M82 and NGC 253. With these observations we will determine the cooling rate of the coronal gas, and compare it with the energy input from supernovae. This will allow us to determine whether cooling strongly affects the dynamical evolution of these winds. We will also investigate the kinematics of the gas in the wind, and compare this to the kinematics of cooler gas seen in the C III lambda 977 emission line. In conjunction with FUSE O VI absorption measurements of other starbursts in cycles 1 and 2, Chandra X-ray images, and optical emission line data, these observations will provide a greater understanding of the evolution of starburst superwinds.
C132|2| |JEAN-CLAUDE|BOURET|LAS de Marseille| The wide circumstellar disk of dust and gas of Beta Pictoris is one ofthe most fascinating and well studied object of todays astronomy.  Recent osbervations by ISO (Thi et al. 2001) and by FUSE (Lecaveliers des Etangs et al. 2001; Deleuil et al. 2001) still have brought new surprises.  FUSE observations of Beta Pictoris have indeed revealed the very first emission lines in the spectrum of this star. Broad emission lines of highly ionized species like C III and O VI were detected, well above the low continuum level.  It has been suggested that they may originate either from a solar-like extented chromosphere or from magnetospheric accretion.  Besides, O VI emission lines provided enough background flux to show that the total mass of H2 available in the line of sight to Beta Pictoris is much smaller than what was expected from ISO observations (Thi et al. 2001).  A tentative explanation to reconcile both sets of data is that H2 is distributed in clumps instead of being uniformly distributed in the CS disk.  This, in turn, shows the need of further observations to clarify the processes occuring in the late stages of the planetary formation and the dissipation of the molecular gas from which planets form.  Hence, we propose two deep exposures on the Beta Pictoris system with two main goals - first, the higher signal-to-noise ratio will allow us to search for H2 at an unprecedented sensitivity; second, the analysis of the emission line profiles and variability will allow to understand the physical mechanism responsible for the gas heating.
C138|2| |THOMAS B.|AKE|Johns Hopkins University| We propose to perform a comparative study of the atmospheric eclipsingbinaries HR 6902 and 22 Vul. Each of these is comprised of a luminous G-type primary with a late B main sequence secondary. The eclipsing nature of these systems allows a determination of the physical conditions in the outer atmospheres of the evolved primary components. The G stars are on different sides of the cool star dividing line between coronal and non-coronal stars. HR 6902 has a thin chromosphere and a hot, low mass-loss wind, seen in C IV and Si IV absorption when the B star passes behind the primary. 22 Vul, on the other hand, shows extended absorption far from the star and a cool, high velocity wind of approx. -200 km s^(-1). It is more like the classical zeta Aur systems, but the Fe II wind lines have peculiar profiles, likely owning to the effects of the radiation field of the hot star. Although located close to each other on the HR diagram, there are fundamental differences in the outer layers of these stars. We propose obtaining FUSE exposures during partial and total eclipse phases to study the kinematics and structure of the transition regions and winds of the primary stars and relate them to other FUSE observations of single objects.  These observations will also be of use in understanding the complex spectra of other, interacting binary systems, where the stellar components are embedded in much denser material due to mass transfer effects.
C140|2| |NICHOLE|KING|Space Telescope Science Institute| We propose to observe late-type Wolf-Rayet stars, Luminous BlueVariables, and luminous hot P Cygni type stars in the LMC with FUSE. These massive (M_initial > 30 M_odot) evolved stars have high mass-loss rates and complex atmospheres, making them difficult for stellar evolution models (and hence isochrones) to reproduce.  The situation can be improved by providing evolution theorists with observationally derived fundamental stellar parameters such as luminosities, effective temperatures, terminal wind velocities, mass-loss rates and atmospheric abundances of hydrogen burning products.  With FUSE we can observe these stars near the effective peaks of their spectral energy distributions - there, spectral emission-lines of CIII, NIII, SiIV, PV, and PIII, and a multitude of blended FeIV or FeIII features are present.  These data, when combined with optical spectroscopy will be modeled using the latest version of the non-LTE, line-blanketed, geometrically extended, expanding atmosphere code of Hillier & Miller (1998, 1999) to estimate the fundamental stellar parameters listed above.  The addition of the FUSE spectral range rigorously tests the synthetic models as the FUV region is extremely sensitive to line-blanketing.  The FUSE data extend the observed range of ionization states and provide additional resonance lines to constrain mass-loss rates and terminal velocities.  In summary FUSE will facilitate more accurate stellar parameters for these stars.  These parameters are important for developing the post-main sequence portion of massive stellar evolution models.  These models are in turn used to generate the isochrones which are used to estimate ages of populations in star forming galaxies.  Additionally, the data from this project will allow us to estimate the photoionization rates of these stars, and their wind kinetic energy, momentum, and chemical yields to the ISM with some assumptions.
C141|2| |PETER R|YOUNG|Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics| The symbiotic star RR Telescopii holds a special place amongst UVspectroscopists due to the extraordinary richness of the emission line spectrum emitted by the nebula around the system, which has proved to be an extremely fruitful laboratory for both plasma modeling and line identification.  FUSE will obtain, for the first time, a high spectral resolution spectrum in the 900-1100 A region at high sensitivity.  RR Tel has not previously been considered for observing with FUSE on account of the O VI line fluxes being well above the FUSE flux limits. A way to observe RR Tel safely with FUSE by only obtaining spectra through the SiC channels is outlined in the feasibility section that follows.
C149|2| |JASON X.|PROCHASKA|Carnegie Observatories| Earlier this year we initiated a program to investigate the physicalnature of low z O VI absorption lines, systems which may contribute significantly to the cosmological baryonic budget.  The principle goal of this program is to establish and examine the association between O VI gas and galactic haloes, galaxy groups, clusters, or other large-scale structures (e.g. filaments) through the synthesis of two observational projects - (1) the analysis of high SN FUSE spectra of extragalactic sources for z < 0.15 O VI systems; and (2) a large ground-based galaxy survey with the WFCCD at Las Campanas Observatory.  We propose to obtain high-SN FUSE spectra of four moderate redshift AGNs to catalog O VI systems along these sightlines to a 3-sigma limiting EW of 30 mA.  The proposed observations will increase the redshift path for O VI by approx. 50 percent and significantly improve the cosmic scatter in the current FUSE database.  We have obtained galaxy redshifts (to 95 percent completeness limit at R < 19.5) for fields around two of these sight lines and have been awarded further observing time for the other two in the fall.  The combination of high-SN FUSE spectra and ground-based optical redshifts for these sightlines will allow a detailed study on the nature of this very important reservoir of ionized gas at low redshift.
C151|2| |NICOLE|ST-LOUIS|Universite de Montreal| We propose to secure a time sequence of ultraviolet (UV) spectra forthe shortest-period WC+O binary system known, HD36521 (P1.9 days) to study the physical parameters and the structure of the bow shock zone formed when the winds of the two hot stars collide. Of particular importance in the FUSE UV range is the presence of a broad spread of emission lines with different ionization levels, ranging from O VI to C III.  These lines are expected to arise in the bow shock zone at progressively larger distances from the X-ray heated bow head, as the compressed plasma flows outward along the shock cone and cools.  The study of how these lines vary with orbital phase will allow us to map out the structure and kinematics of the bow shock.  This in turn will provide useful constraints on the basic parameters of the winds as well as the collision process itself.  HD36521 is known to show strong wind-wind collision effects.  Among the 4 known WC+O binaries observable with FUSE, this is the last one to be examined. We will compare its behavior with our data already obtained for the other three systems.
C152|2| |CHARLES D.|KEYES|Space Telescope Science Institute| To study the accretion and outbursts in symbiotic systems, weorganized a multi-wavelength, target-of-opportunity (TOO) observing program including FUSE cycle 2, Chandra, XMM, and the VLA.  The prototype symbiotic, Z And, entered its largest outburst in decades in September 2000 and has been observed at several epochs with all of these instruments.  We propose to continue FUSE observation of Z And at two epochs in cycle 3 as the outburst declines from maximum to the important quiescent state.  The evolution of the X-ray and UV spectrum throughout the outburst will play a vital role in distinguishing between the outburst models currently in contention for describing outburst behavior.  Emission line strengths of the FUSE-band species, especially when combined with lines of the same species from the other spectral regions, will provide diagnostics of the colliding windshock region.  The high-resolution of FUSE-band absorption features will provide a unique opportunity to probe several aspects of the outburst material.  Note especially that FUSE provides important information for the analysis of the x-ray data as FUSE observations of HI absorption are at sufficiently high resolution to allow the separation of the interstellar component from the systemic component of the absorption.
C153|2| |ROBIN L.|SHELTON|Johns Hopkins University| Ultraviolet resonance line emission from O VI ions in thediffuse interstellar medium has been detected unambiguously by FUSE.  The results have been used to estimate the average conditions electron density and thermal pressure) along two lines of sight through the local hot gas and Galactic halo. Here we propose to distinguish local O VI emission from Galactic halo emission using the shadowing method.  The results of the proposed observation will provide crucial insights into the conditions and dynamics of the hot gas in the Galactic halo.  The combination of the proposed observation with previously approved FUSE and XMM observations will provide the necessary information with the minimum additional exposure time.
C154|2| |THEODORE|GULL|NASAs GSFC| Eta Carinae, the best-known Luminous Blue Variable (LBV), continues toconfound astronomers as to what drives its historical outbursts and periodic changes. Is Eta Carinae a single star or a binary system In the past four years, determination of a spectroscopic 5.5-year period led to coordinated observations throughout the spectrum that confirmed the periodicity. While the evidence leans heavily towards a binary system, direct evidence of a companion star is yet to be found. An alternative explanation is that Eta Carinae is a single star near the Eddington limit undergoing periodic mini-explosions. One possible way to differentiate the two models is monitoring of the FUV with FUSE through the next spectroscopic minimum, predicted to be 2003.5. As part of that monitoring activity, we request two 0 ksec observations during Cycle 3.
C155|2| |STAN|OWOCKI|Univ. of Delaware| We propose to use the unique capabilities of FUSE to monitor thetime-dependent behavior of the stellar wind profiles in two O7 supergiants, one in the LMC and one in the SMC.  These observations will enable us to examine the physical properties of co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs).  Specifically, we will (1) observe how the state of wind material changes when CIRs traverse the stellar surface; 2) perform a meaningful search for ionization changes due to these structures; and (3) determine how wind activity is affected by metallicitymass loss rate.  A previous FUSE monitoring campaign has shown that stellar wind variability in an LMC O4 supergiant is similar to that in its Galactic counterpart.  However, because the winds of early O stars are not strongly affected by CIRs, we now seek to extend the observations to O7 stars.  Galactic O7 stars show the strongest temporally coherent wind variability, which is normally interpreted as CIRs.  The new observations will enable us to focus on CIR-related variability and thereby provide the data necessary to constrain models of CIRs, which are rapidly becoming a paradigm in the field.  
C157|2| |GERALDINE J.|PETERS|University of Southern California| FUSE observations of the interacting binaries V356 Sgr (B2V + A2II)and TT Hya (B9.5Ve + K1III-IV) in Cycle 1 at several phase points during totality revealed the presence of broad O VI emission that was especially strong in V356 Sgr.  The high temperature plasma that produces this emission is presumably located at the base of the polar jets in these systems that were detected from HST-FOS spectropolarimetry. In order to determine physical conditions in the jet and obtain information on its geometry and formation, we propose new FUSE observations of V356 Sgr, TT Hya, and a comparison system RY Per (B3V + F6III). New observations of V356 Sgr will provide information on whether the O VI emission is concentrated near the site where the gas stream impacts the primary or if it emanates from an extended region and will enable one to assess whether the jet is a stable structure. Since the Cycle 1 observations revealed that the O VI Si III, and other emission lines vary during totality in V356 Sgr, we request a continuous set of FUSE exposures throughout the 10.2 hr eclipse that include the ingress and egress phases.  Observations of RY Per throughout its 2.3 hr total phase are proposed to investigate the effect of binary separation on the polar plasma, as it has similar component stars to those in V356 Sgr but a shorter period.  To remove the contribution from the strong ISM lines, mostly H_2, that pervade the emission features, we request a single observation of each star outside of eclipse.
C158|2| |GERALDINE J.|PETERS|University of Southern California| We propose FUSE observations of AV304 (B0.5V) and NGC346-637B0V), two sharp-lined main-sequence stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, to determine the abundances of heavy elements, especially those of the iron group. The FUSE spectral region contains numerous Fe III lines, including the resonance multiplet (UV 1) near 1130 Angstroms, that is excellent for abundance determinations and two strong multiplets of V III, an ion that does not produce measurable lines longward of 1200 Angstoms, in metal-deficient stars.  In addition there are several measurable lines from Cr III and Mn III. A limited analyses of ground-based spectra of these stars by Dufton et al. (1990) and Rolleston et al. (1993) indicated an average underabundance of 0.7-0.8 dex for most light elements and a recent analysis of HSTSTIS data on AV304 by Peters & Grigsby (2001) suggests that the Fe group elements are depleted by the same amount relative to the sun.  When combined with the HST-STIS results, this effort will represent the first attempt to measure the abundances of Fe group elements in the photospheres of early B, main sequence stars in an external galaxy. Although abundances of the Fe-peak elements are of interest because they are important for assessing opacities for stellar evolution calculations and the validity of theoretical calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis, the ground-based study did not yield this information because measurable lines from these species are found only in the UV spectral region.  Abundances and abundance ratios of both heavy & light elements will be compared with the HST-STIS results from AV304, H II regions, supernova remnants, evolved massive stars in the SMC, and theoretical calculations of nucleosynthesis.
C160|2| |DERCK|MASSA|Goddard Space Flight Center| The theory of hot-star winds predicts that the structure of theoutflow changes abruptly near a specific stellar temperature. This transition in wind properties is called the bistability jump, and occurs when the quality of the stellar radiation field causes a major shift in the ionization state of the abundant metals that drive the wind.  For example, the jump occurs near B1 for Galactic stars, when the dominant ionization stage of Fe in the subsonic region of the atmosphere switches from Fe IV in the hotter stars to Fe III in the cooler ones. The result of the transition is that stars on the cooler side of the jump have more massive, denser, and slower winds.  Theory predicts the location, magnitude, and metallicity dependence of the jump.  Observations of these quantities will constitute significant tests of the theory, and will provide important observational feedback to the models.  The Magellanic Clouds provide an ideal laboratory for mapping the location of the bistability jump in the H-R diagram and its dependence on metallicity.  Furthermore, the far-UV is the ideal spectral region to search for the effects, since it contains a wealth of resonance line diagnostics that span a wide range of ionization potentials.  We therefore propose to use FUSE to observe early B supergiants in both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, in order to determine empirically the metallicity dependence of the temperature at which the bistability jump occurs, and to estimate its impact on the velocity field of the wind and the mass flux it carries.
C161|2| |PAUL|BARRETT|Space Telescope Science Institute| A long sought-after group of polars are those with high magnetic field>60 MG), because they may provide valuable clues to the structure and dynamics of accretion in strong magnetic fields and the evolution of CVs in general.  The discovery of several soft X-ray polars by ROSAT and their subsequent identification as high field polars supports the conclusion that the bremsstrahlung is suppressed at higher fields and cyclotron cooling predominates. We propose time-resolved FUV spectroscopy of high field polars to study their accretion kinematics, their high excitation lines (e.g. O VI, O IV, and Si IV), and the distribution of gas in the binary.  
C162|2| |PAUL|BARRETT|Space Telescope Science Institute| Eclipsing polars have long provided important information about thestructure and dynamics of magnetic cataclysmic variables by providing precise information about the location of the emitting gas within the binary system.  Previous such studies have shown that the X-ray emission is located on or very near the white dwarf surface, while the optical and near-UV emission is predominantly from the surface of the secondary star.  We propose time-resolved observations of several eclipsing polars to better understand the far UV emission in these binaries.  The combination of eclipse mapping and doppler tomography will enable us to make detailed maps of the accretion stream and to better understand the formation of the high excitation lines.  FUSE with its high time and spectral resolution and good sensitivity is an excellent means for accomplishing these objectives.
C163|2| |PRAJVAL|SHASTRI|Indian Institute of Astrophysics| We propose to attack the question of whether orientation plays adominant role in the observed hot gaseous outflows in Seyfert galaxies.  We plan to do this by contrasting the properties of the O VI absorbers in a matched sample of Seyfert 1s and 2s, which, in the framework of the Unified Scheme, are oriented face-on and end-on respectively w.r.t. us. The O VI emission line is present in all Seyferts, and is a unique characterizer of the kinematics of gas at T approx. 10^6 K. The spectral sensitivity and resolution of FUSE in this range makes it possible to discern the different components of the absorbing outflow. The key points of our investigation are (a) the Seyfert 1s and 2s have been chosen to be intrinsically similar, and thus provide a very clean statistical comparison of face-on and end-on Seyferts and therefore a rigorous test of orientation effects, and (b) all the Seyfert 1s and three of the Seyfert 2s are already observed by FUSE, so that only five more targets are required to complete FUSE observations for this unique, well-matched sample of 16 Seyfert galaxies.
C164|2| |ERIC J.|KORPELA|University of California, Berkeley| The Eridanus superbubble has been called the Rosetta Stone ofsuperbubbles because virtually all of the processes which shape the interstellar medium are taking place somewhere within its boundaries.  One of the features of this region is the Eridanus Soft X-ray enhancement.  It is understood that this enhancement is a region of hot (> 3x10^6 K) gas that fills the Eridanus cavity.  We propose to investigate two lines of sight for O VI lambda lambda 1032,1038 emission, one which intersects an optically thick neutral cloud located within the X-ray emitting region and one which does not intersect the cloud.  The observation of the line of sight not intersecting the cloud, combined with a Cycle 2 archival absorption measurement of a QSO on a very nearby line of sight, will allow us to accurately determine the physical properties of 10^(5.5) K gas within the superbubble.  The line of sight intersecting the cloud will provide additional information about the physical location of the emitting regions and the interface between the cloud and the hot gas in which it is embedded.  These data will allow us to distinguish between contrary theories of the structure of the ISM and energy transport mechanisms that occur within it.
C165|2| |WALT|HARRIS|University of Wisconsin|We propose to study nearby young stars for evidence of comets andauroral emissions from Jovian-class planets, and to monitor FUV diagnostics of chromospheric activity to increase our understanding of temperature, structure, and flares in cool star atmospheres.  SOHO/SWAN observations of comet C/1995O1 (Hale-Bopp) and models of its (r $>$ 100000 km) optically thick H coma suggest that comets crossing our line of sight to their stars will attenuate stellar Ly-$\beta$ emission over a narrow band corresponding to their astrocentric velocity.  During the bombardment phase of planetary formation, the frequency of comets is much greater than the modern rate, increasing the likelihood of a transit occurring.  Discovery of a transit would be significant for our understanding of planet formation and provide another technique for finding planet systems.  FUV auroral emission on Jovian class planets that are near their parent star provides a potential means of directly observing these objects.  Extrapolation from the Jovian aurora suggests that detection of a large planet inside of 1 AU is possible around a nearby active star. Our targets are the EMS active stars $\chi^{1}$ Ori (G0, 9 pc, 100 Myr) and E Eri (K2, 3.3 pc, 1 Gyr).  $\epsilon$ Eri has a known planet of 1.2 Mj with a 0.7 AU perihelion distance.
C168|2| |FREDERICK C.|BRUHWEILER|The Catholic Univ. of America| Both the O star, HD148937, and the O stars of the Rosette Nebula areembedded in extremely young wind-blown interstellar (IS) bubbles. The ages of these bubbles are less than 10^5 yr, much younger than the central O stars. These ages are also far too young compared with theoretical predictions for IS-bubbles. We will use FUSE to observe the O stars in these two IS-bubbles. FUSE allows us, for the first time, to go beyond heuristic calculations and make detailed comparisons with theoretical models. We will obtain column densities of interstellar species not accessible from HST and IUE. We will use column densities and the deduced velocities of the species, C II, C III, N II, and N III, together with those from HST and IUE data, to provide reliable estimates of the total mass in the expanding shells of the IS-bubbles. We will also search for O VI at velocities of the conductive interfaces of the expanding shells encompassing the hot cavities. We will use the derived NC ratio for the H II region around HD148937 to ascertain if this gas is N-rich and whether it is composed largely of outflow from an earlier red supergiant evolutionary phase of HD148937. The implications of this study are far-reaching. Stellar winds are one of the primary energy inputs for the ISM and are extremely important for determining the Galactic filling factor for the hot component to the ISM as well as understanding galactic morphology and evolution both now and in the Early Universe.
C169|2| |BRIAN|ESPEY|Space Telescope Science Institute| EG-AND is symbiotic binary which is bright in both optical and UV, andshows little evidence for dust along the line of sight, making it an ideal candidate for FUSE. EG-AND has never been observed in outburst, but its brightness permits the detection of its outflowing wind v_infty approx. 500 km per sec, and dot-M approx. 5x10^-8 M_odot). During periodic occultations by the giant primary, the signature of Rayleigh scattering is strongly evident in the UV.  At such times the white dwarf continuum provides a background source against which the outer layers of the relatively cool giant can be observed.  Unlike massive binaries, the winds of a symbiotic system have very different characteristics -- the hot wind is relatively thin and fast, whereas the cool wind is slow and weakly ionized -- and hence they can be isolated spectroscopically.  The far-UV region of the spectrum is rich in a range of permitted and semi-permitted lines ranging from low to high excitation, and also containing the molecular features of H_2, thus permitting the diagnosis of material from the base of the giants wind, the white dwarf wind, and the hot, shocked, material where the two interact. Phase-resolved spectra thus provide the unique tomographic information we require to model these systems and understand how the winds are generated and interact.  For all these reasons, EG-AND is a prime target for FUSE if we wish to understand wind formation in both white dwarfs and cool giants.  These observations are also vital for testing line-driven wind theory.
C171|2| |JOY|NICHOLS|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory| The Cyg OB1 superbubble is apparently formed by the merger of severalsmaller superbubbles that were produced by non-coeval evolution of the parent stellar association.  Such non-coeval evolution of clusters and associations may be common, but the Cyg OB1 superbubble is the best example for detailed study because of its proximity, relatively young age, and the presence of the parent association.  We propose to observe several stars that are members of the parent association, sampling lines of sight toward the full spatial extent of this elongated superbubble to obtain absorption line measurements of O VI.  We will use the O VI data collected by FUSE to map temperature and shock parameters in these various neighborhoods of the Cyg OB1 superbubble. The observational data, combined with the calculated energy budget, will be used to model the time-dependent multi-bubble evolution of this superbubble.  
C172|2| |ROSINA|IPING|Catholic University of America| NGC 4038-9 (the Antennae) is the nearest ongoing galaxy mergerand a prototype of the much more frequent galaxy collisions seen at high redshifts.  Recent Chandra observations confirm the existence of a substantial hot soft-X-ray halo around the system, and clearly delineate the locations of very hot gas associated with the moderate starburst ongoing in the system.  Observations of HI 21 cm, CO, and H alpha emission have been used to explore the dynamics and kinematics of the cooler gas in the system, both in the tidal tails and in the star forming regions.  However, little is known about how the very hot gas is heated, particularly in the halo, or about the ISM and detailed connections between the interaction process, enhanced star-formation, and heating of the X-ray emitting gas.  We will use FUSE absorption spectra to probe the kinematics and composition of the hot and warm ISM along three sightlines, through three different regions of the NGC4038-9 halo, to different regions in the galactic disks.  Pointings have been selected to probe regions with different starburst ages, different X-ray and H alpha emission properties, and differenthalo gas properties. We will search for O VI in both emission and absorption, and will use OVI with other shock heated  species, to determine the distribution, composition, and  dynamics of the hot (approx. 3x10^5 K) halo gas and of hot gas in the disks.  In the same observations, we will use measures of the warm (approx. 10^4 K) gas in the HII regions to determine and compare abundances, physical properties, and bulk motions of the material associated with three different star-forming regions.  We will also make direct measures of the amount of diffuse H_2, the dominant component of the ISM,  in different regions of the merger system.
C176|2| |ROSINA|IPING|Catholic University of America| The high-excitation planetary nebulae NGC 7009 and its central starwere observed with FUSE through the 30x30 arcsec slit as an Early Release Observation in 1999 Nov. The spectrum shows strong emission from He II, C III, N II, N III, S III, S IV, S VI, and several unidentified features superposed on the continuum of the hot central star.  We propose to use the 4x20 arcsec slit to isolate the inner and outer parts of the nebula without the central star to study the large number of lines expected from the nebula with much better spectral resolution. We also hope to study several key emission lines, including O VI 1032-38 and S VI 933-44, that are masked or absorbed by the stellar spectrum in the earlier observation.  The C III 1175 and Ne VI multiplets should provide good density diagnostics of the hot gas. The central star will also be reobserved with the narrower slit to obtain its spectrum with higher spectral resolution (approx. 30 kms) and with significantly reduced contamination from nebular emission.  
C177|2| |KLAUS|WERNER|Universitat Tubingen| The temperature scale of the hottest central stars of planetarynebulae is poorly known. FUSE FUV spectra in combination with HST UV observations will allow precise temperature determinations by utilizing ionization balances of C III, C IV and O V, O VI lines. We have established a sample of eight stars for which we are currently obtaining HST spectra.  The sample comprises hot hydrogen-rich central stars covering the hottest phase of post-AGB evolution (T_eff > 70,000K). The spectra shall be analyzed with fully metal line blanketed NLTE model atmospheres in order to determine T_eff, surface gravity, and chemical composition. Besides the temperature scale the results will address the following problem - Depending on the particular star, the metal abundances are either dominated by current diffusion processes or they originate from dredge-up phases during previous AGB evolution. We expect that our sample comprises different objects allowing both processesphases to be studied in detail.  a.) Those objects, which show qualitatively a metal abundance pattern which points at dredge-up phases, can be used to quantitatively check against abundance predictions of stellar evolution theory.  b.) The other objects, where gravitational diffusion and radiative acceleration determine the photospheric metal abundances, will be used to check our NLTE models which for the first time include diffusion processes self-consistently.
C178|2| |THOMAS|RAUCH|Universitat Tubingen| The O(He) stars are found in the post-AGB region of the HRD, just amongst thePG 1159 stars. In contrast to the latter, they do neither show carbon nor oxygen lines in their optical spectra but exhibit almost pure He II absorption-line spectra. Thus, two possibilities are conceivable to interpret their evolutionary status Either they are direct PG 1159 progenitors and ongoing mass loss due to a stellar wind will take off the remaining He-rich envelope and lay free carbon- and oxygen-rich material at their surface. Or they just experienced a less efficient mass loss on the AGB and define a new evolutionary channel into the DO white dwarfs.  The proposed FUV spectroscopy aims to determine the mass-loss rates and C and O abundances of all four presently known O(He) stars for the first time. This will allow to constrain their further evolution Significant higher mass-loss rates than predicted by radiation-driven wind theory might turn the O(He) stars into PG 1159 stars.
D003|4| | |Welsh|University of California at Berkeley|We shall observe the absorption characteristics of interstellar gas residing in the Local Chimney, which is an extension of the hot Local Bubble cavity that reaches into the inner-halo region. By combining these data with previous FUSE observations of this interstellar cavity we shall be able to accurately determine the kinetic temperature, electron density, element abundance/ depletions and gross velocity structure of gas in the Local Bubble as a function of increasing height above the galactic disk as it merges into the inner galactic halo. A key feature of these observations will be to detect infall of interstellar matter from the halo onto the galactic plane.
D004|4| | |Hutchings|Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics|We propose FUSE observations to cover the 5.6-hour orbital period of the prototype eclipsing low-mass X-ray binary X1822$-$37.  The system has a complex accretion disk structure which causes nearly continuous variations at all wavelengths.  An accretion disk corona envelopes the binary, and X-rays heat the surface of the donor star.  Because the compact star is a pulsar, the orbital parameters are well known.  FUSE spectra covering the binary orbit, including through eclipse, will probe the hot inner disk by observing its high ionization emission lines, the outer disk via Lyman absorption lines, and the location of hot continuum sources.  FUSE data will provide unique new information on the properties of the accretion disk, mass flows within the system, and the surrounding gas envelope.  In 7 FUSE orbits we can sample the orbital period fully, accounting for earth occultations.
D005|4| | |Hutchings|Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics|We propose to observe the luminous LMC X-ray binary X0535$-$668 which consists of a highly interacting Be-star/neutron-star pair.  During periastron passage in the very eccentric 16.65-day orbit (e$>$0.7), the neutron star plunges into the envelope of the Be star.  Optical and IUE studies have shown that significant changes occur in the emission at all wavelengths.  FUSE spectra will allow us to sample a wide range of ionization states to see how various species vary with orbital phase and hence infer their origin within the system.  Study of O~VI resonance lines around the orbit will give information on mass loss from the system through its variable stellar wind and how it changes through the eccentric orbit.  With FUSE data it will also be possible to detect any cool H$_2$ envelope that may surround the system.
D006|4| | |Crampton|NRC of Canada|In a successful Cycle 2 FUSE program we observed RX~J0513.9$-$6951 through its 16-hour binary orbit.  The spectra revealed extraordinarily broad ($\pm$ 3000 km/sec) O~VI emission with a velocity variation which appears to define the orbital motion of the accreting white dwarf, assuming the lines arise in the inner accretion disk.  The FUV O~VI profile is unique, and it provides the only direct measurement of the component masses in a supersoft binary.  However, the system is known to show non-orbital spectral changes as well as long-term changes in the disk structure.  Since only slightly over one orbital cycle was observed by FUSE, we do not know if the measured velocities truly represent the WD's motion or if some non-orbital changes influenced the spectral lines.  Therefore, we propose a second observational sequence in order to make a more definitive determination of the periodic O~VI velocity variations and hence the important stellar masses.  We will also investigate the origin of the strong FUV continuum variations and the peculiar moving Lyman absorptions which were observed during our first series of observations.
D007|4| | |Gull|NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center|An unique opportunity will occur in early summer 2003 - Eta Carinae will go through its periodic minimum, which occurs every 5.52 years (2020+/-10 days). This very massive stellar system may harbor clues to the final evolutionary stages of massive stars before the supernova event, possibly even a Gamma Ray Burster event. Some have suggested that we may gain insight to the proposed very massive stars that likely formed of hydrogen and helium in the early Universe, perhaps before the first galaxies.  We have considerable motivation to understand the physics of Eta Carinae and its ejecta. Systematic studies with HST/STIS since 1998.0, the time of the last minimum, have demonstrated that excitation and ionization of ejecta close to the central star(s) drop during the minimum, but return over the next year. Emission lines of doubly-ionized Fe, N, Ne, Si, and Ar disappear; Lyman alpha-pumped Fe II lines weaken, but Mid-UV and NUV continuum-pumped Fe II lines actually brighten! FUV radiation from the central source(s) is thought to drive this system. Attempts to model the central source as a single massive P-Cygni star have failed. Models of the X-Ray emission suggest wind-wind collisions of a binary star system with the companion being an early O-star!  Recently we have determined that the apparent FUSE P-Cygni profiles are actually multiple absorption components from ejecta, not the stellar wind. During Cycle 4 we propose to observe the FUV spectrum directly, and monitor its changes across the minimum that influence the NUV, visible and near-red spectrum. These observations would be coordinated with Hubble Treasury and CHANDRA proposals already accepted for the upcoming minimum. FUSE will provide very important insight on the changes in excitation and ionization of the very clumpy ejecta that cannot be provided any other way. This may be the ONLY opportunity to obtain this information in the near future.
D008|4| | |Richter|Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri|FUSE is the first instrument allowing a systematic investigation of the abundance and properties of diffuse molecular hydrogen (H_2) beyond the local Galactic ISM. In a large survey, we have studied the H_2 content of intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs) in the Milky Way halo with FUSE data available from the FUSE data archive. The quality of the archival data, however, is not sufficient to study in detail the physical processes in the IVCs that govern the formation and dissociation of H_2 in this gas. We therefore propose to observe three Galactic halo stars with FUSE to sample the molecular gas phase at good S/N in the Low Latitude Intermediate Velocity Arch (LLIV Arch), where H_2 has been detected before. This will allow us to investigate the properties of the cold neutral medium in these halo clouds, and will be important to better understand the abundance of diffuse H_2 in other galaxies and in the intergalactic medium.
D009|4| | |Young|Rutherford Appleton Laboratory| 
D010|4| | |Shastri|Indian Institute of Astrophysics|We propose to attack the question of whether orientation plays a dominant role in the observed hot gaseous outflows in Seyfert galaxies.  We plan to do this by contrasting the properties of the O VI absorbers in a matched sample of Seyfert1s and 2s, which, in the framework of the Unified Scheme, are oriented face-on and end-on respectively w.r.t. us.  The OVI emission line is present in all Seyferts, and is a unique characterizer of the kinematics of gas at about 10e6K. The spectral sensitivity and resolution of FUSE in this range makes it possible  to discern the different components of the absorbing outflow. The key points of our investigation are (a) the Seyfert1s and 2s have been chosen to be intrinsically similar, and thus provide a very clean statistical comparison of face-on and end-on Seyferts and therefore a rigorous test of orientation effects, and (b) all the Seyfert1s and three of the Seyfert2s are already observed by FUSE, so that only five more targets are required to complete FUSE observations for this unique, well-matched sample of 16 Seyfert galaxies.
D014|4| | |Federman|University of Toledo| 
D015|4| | |Keenan|Queen's University of Belfast|Previous FUSE studies have revealed the presence of large amounts of high-velocity ($\mid$V$_{LSR}$$\mid$ $>$ 100\kms) hot gas towards Galactic halo sightlines, detected via \ion{O}{6} absorption lines in high-velocity clouds (HVCs). However, these sightlines are all extragalactic, and hence the observations do not provide any insight into a crucial HVC parameter --- the distance. As part of a continuing program to investigate the distribution and origin of hot stars in the Galactic halo, we have obtained high resolution ($\sim$\,0.1\ang FWHM)  optical echelle spectra of many faint B-type Post-AGB stars at high Galactic latitudes. Detailed model atmosphere analyses of these spectra have allowed us to derive reliable atmospheric parameters, and hence determine stellar distances accurate to $\sim$\,20\%. We have identified a sample of our stars at distances from the Galactic plane ({\em z}) of up to 13\,kpc, and which lie close in the sky (within 9\deg) to AGNs with HVC \ion{O}{6} absorption in their sightlines. The detection of HVC \ion{O}{6} absorption in our stellar sample will show that this hot gas lies close to the Galaxy, and hence either originates from the Galaxy (e.g. a Galactic fountain or wind), or arises via some interaction with the Galaxy (e.g. cloud interactions with a Galactic corona). However null detections will also provide useful constraints, indicating that the HVCs are extragalactic in origin, such as intergalactic gas in the Local Group.
D021|4| | |Meyer|Northwestern University|Based on high-resolution HST STIS observations over the 1165-1360 A wavelength region, Meyer et al. (2001) have discovered that HD 37903 (the illuminating star of the bright reflection nebula NGC 2023 in Orion) exhibits a rich spectrum of vibrationally-excited interstellar H2 absorption.  A FUSE spectrum of HD 37903 obtained 20 months after the STIS observations and recently made publicly available in the FUSE data archive reveals excited H2 lines that are appreciably weaker than one would expect from the STIS data.  If these variations are real, they would imply structure on scales of 1-2 AU in the foreground vibrationally-excited H2 gas of the NGC 2023 photodissociation region (PDR).  We propose to obtain a higher S/N FUSE spectrum of HD 37903 and through a comparison with the initial FUSE data determine if and to what extent there are real temporal variations in the excited H2 absorption toward this object.  These observations will provide a unique view of small-scale PDR structure that is well beyond the capability of near-IR H2 emission observations.
D023|4| | |Vennes|Australian National University|We have completed our optical survey of X-ray DA selected white dwarfs and built a new sample of 178 objects with well defined stellar parameters. Some 104 objects from this sample are joint detections in the ROSAT/PSPC and EUVE/lexan surveys; they range between temperatures of 24,000 and 84,000 K.  We calibrated the PSPC/lexan count rate ratios and discovered a class of X-ray deficient DA white dwarfs with intermediate temperatures (26,000 < T < 40,000) which are most likely contaminated with heavy elements such as iron. We propose a direct spectroscopic identification of iron---and lighter elements--- in a sub-sample of four objects which would constitute the first evidence that trace heavy elements persist in the atmosphere of these objects at all temperatures. We interpret the phenomenon as evidence of on-going accretion from the immediate environment of the white dwarfs.
D024|4| | |Sembach|Space Telescope Science Institute|We will observe a position near one AGN behind the Magellanic Stream (Fairall 9) to measure the O VI emission associated with the hot gas detected in O VI absorption along this sight line.  Our goals are to [1] Quantify the amount of O VI emission associated with the O VI absorption in this direction toward the Magellanic Stream.  [2] Estimate the physical conditions ($n_e$, $p/k$, etc.) in the gas and the likely cloud geometry by comparing the O VI emission and absorption-line strengths, and determining which hot gas models are capable of producing the observed emission/absorption ratios.  [3] Lay the groundwork for future O VI emission-line maps with the SPIDR mission by observationally quantifying the amount of O VI emission expected in directions with O VI absorption estimates.  The proposed observations will also provide HIRS aperture absorption-line spectra of the the extragalactic continuum source near the LWRS position.
D025|4| | |Rauch|Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg|AA Dor is a close binary consisting of an sdOB primary star and possibly a planet (M = 0.066 Msun). The planet may have survived a common envelope phase and has even gained mass. A recent spectral analysis of the primary based on high-resolution CASPEC and IUE spectra was hampered by the relatively long exposure times (1h and 2 -- 3h, respectively) and hence, a relatively large orbital velocity coverage. We propose high-resolution and high-SN spectroscopy with FUSE in order to determine precisely the photospheric metal abundances of the primary. The relatively short exposure time (10 * 200 sec) and the much better S/N ratio in the co-added spectrum at a higher resolution will reduce the error range in the abundance ratios by a factor of ten. Moreover, the high resolution allows to identify individual iron an nickel lines in the spectrum and thus, the iron/nickel abundance ratio can be analyzed. Since there still exists a discrepancy between the resulting stellar parameters from spectral analysis and those derived from the radial-velocity and the eclipse curves, the evaluation of the higher members of the Lyman series will additionally improve the determination of the surface gravity which should solve this problem. Moreover, from the comparison to evolutionary models we can derive the mass of the primary and derive the mass of the secondary, which is a candidate for the first planet found as a by-product of spectral analysis by means of NLTE model atmospheres.
D026|4| | |Andersson|The Johns Hopkins University|Five times ionized oxygen, OVI, is an important diagnostic of the interstellar  medium (ISM) in both the Galaxy and in extragalactic environments, where it  traces gas transitioning between hot and cool states.  However, direct  observations of such transition zones are few as the location and geometry of  the individual regions are usually not known.  We have, in a pilot study,  identified one such OVI formation region in the outskirts of the Southern  Coalsack molecular cloud, where X-ray emitting plasma interacts with a cool  dense cloud.  We will here further probe this hot-cold interface in  order to elucidate the details of the gas mixing and OVI generating processes.
D027|4| | |Savage|University of Wisconsin|We propose to obtain 100 and 250 ksec integrations of the bright QSOs HE\,0226$-$4110 (z = 0.495) and Ton\,236 (z = 0.450) in order to study the physical conditions and baryonic content of the highly ionized IGM. The FUSE observations when combined with HST measurements from 1150 to 1800 \AAwill permit the study of $\sim$13 \OVI\ IGM systems with rest equivalent widths $>$50 m\AA.  The redshifts of the QSOs and the presence of only weak interfering absorption from Galactic H$_2$ will allow us to probe multiple ion states of oxygen (\OVI, \OIV, and \OIII) and possibly \NeVIII.  Having access to a range of ion states is crucial for determining the origin(s) of the ionization and the baryonic content of the highly ionized IGM.This is an important problem in observational cosmology since the first estimates (Tripp et al.\ 2000; Savage et al.\ 2002) imply that the highly ionized IGM is a major reservoir of the baryons in the universe at low redshift.
D028|4| | |Wakker|University of Wisconsin Madison|Simulations of the formation of large-scale structure in the universe predict that at the present time a large fraction of the baryons is in a warm/hot phase, T=\dex5--\dex7 K. This gas probably has been detected in absorption through the \OVI\ $\lambda\lambda$1031.926, 1037.671 doublet at redshifts of $\sim$0.1--0.3. A value of dN/dz(\OVI)=14$^{+9}_{-6}$ is derived for absorption with equivalent width $>$50 m\AA. In our sample of 100 extra-galactic objects observed with FUSE, we find 5 such detections of \OVI\ at redshifts $<$0.004, where 2 are expected for the redshift path of 0.099. We also find 7 more probable or possible \OVI\ absorbers with EW$<$50 m\AA. We propose to obtain improved data for the four most intriguing of these detections (toward Ton\,S180, Mrk\,876, PG\,0844+349 and Mrk\,478) in order to be able to accurately measure their properties, something that is not feasible with the current data. Three of these sightlines pass within 250 kpc of large, nearby spirals and may sample their halos. We should be able to determine the relation between the nearby galaxies and the \OVI\ absorption and also whether these absorbers are similar to or different from the detections at higher redshifts.
D030|4| | |Martins|Observatoire Midi-Pyrenees|We propose to obtain FUSE spectra of a sample of young massive stars, which are part of the poorly understood class of Vz stars supposed to lie close to the ZAMS. In particular, as our preliminary work shows, such objects seem to have extremely weak stellar winds compared to other O stars, challenging thereby our current understanding of the radiation driven wind theory. Our main goal is to determine the stellar and wind properties of these objects to understand this apparent peculiarity, and in general to understand their evolutionary status and their link with regions of massive star formation. The requested observations, together with  optical ESO/EMMI/NTT and UV STIS/HST observations, will provide a large set of spectral lines leading to stellar and wind parameters through line fitting with non-LTE spherically extended models including line blanketing. The opportunity offered by FUSE to observe stars in the Magellanic Clouds will also allow to investigate a possible link between the Vz class and metallicity. The results of this multi-wavelength study will improve our knowledge of the earliest optically visible phases of the evolution of massive stars.
D032|4| | |Roberge|Carnegie Institution of Washington|Circumstellar (CS) disks orbiting young stars fall into two categories: primordial disks, composed of unprocessed interstellar dust and gas, and debris disks, produced by the destruction of solid planetary bodies. In the first class, the most abundant gas is H_2; in the second, it appears  that the H_2 gas has disappeared, possibly through incorporation into gas  giant planets.  The lifetime of H_2 gas in a CS disk is therefore of great  importance, as it dictates the timescale for the formation of giant planets.FUSE observations of H_2 in CS disk systems have shown that FUV absorption  spectroscopy may sensitively probe for small amounts of gas along the line  of sight to the star.  Most importantly, the FUSE non-detection of H_2 gas  in the Beta Pictoris disk suggests that the primordial gas lifetime is less  than about 12 Myr, and that gas giant planets must form very quickly.  However, this suggestion is based on one system, and needs to be tested in  additional systems with a range of ages, especially since there are  indications that age is not the only factor in the evolution of a CS disk. We propose for FUSE observations of 3 additional debris disk systems, Fomalhaut, HD3003, and HD2884.  Fomalhaut is an intermediate age debris  disk, one of the Fabulous Four CS disks first discovered in 1984.  The  other two disks are younger, with ages similar to that of Beta Pic. All three stars are brighter in the FUV than Beta Pic, permitting us to sensitively probe for traces of H_2 gas.  We will also measure the amount of  secondary atomic gas produced from planetary bodies in these disks, in an  effort to understand the entire evolution of CS gas in young planetary systems.
D033|4| | |Walter|SUNY Stony Brook|We propose to obtain high S/N O VI line profiles for the ultra-rapid rotator PZ Tel. The goals are twofold - to detect and characterize the broad line wings that may arise in an extended region near the Keplerian corotation radius, and to study the transient absorption (prominence) events in high temperature gas. A 60 ksec observation  of PZ Tel will sample about 1.7 rotation periods, after accounting for  Earth occultations. The line profiles and the variability of the broad pedestal emission provide a test of the hypothesis that much of the chromospheric and coronal emission arises in an extended volume near the Keplerian co-rotation radius. We will organize simultaneous or contemporaneous observations at other wavelengths.
D034|4| | |Bianchi|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose to complete our FUSE observations of Planetary Nebulae in the Magellanic Clouds, with the hottest LMC objects selected from the entire sample studied with HST.  The flux in the HST UV and optical range is dominated by nebular continuum emission. Instead, the far-UV range reveals the spectrum of the central star (CSPN), uniquely enabling a direct estimate of the ionizing source parameters.  The FUSE spectra provide a measurement of Teff, log g, L_bol, abundances, wind velocity and mass loss rate for these post-AGB stars. These parameters are needed to model the nebular dynamics and evolution, and constrain post-AGB evolution at low metallicity. Theoretically, metallicity affects several aspects of the post-AGB evolution, including mass loss and the yield of processed material, important factors in the chemical evolution of galaxies.  Therefore, it is very important to observe PNe in different environments. Results for Milky Way, LMC and SMC CSPNe (combining our observations from previous cycles) will be compared with detailed post-AGB calculations. The brightest (but cooler) LMC CSPNe were observed in Cycle 2.  The successful observations and results so far support our request to complete the sample of such objects accessible to the FUSE sensitivity, observing the LMC CSPNe with highest temperatures. The FUSE data are a unique contribution to constrain the properties of these objects, which are effectively at a single, unambiguous distance.  FUSE spectra 1) disclose the central star spectrum, thus provide the only direct measurement of the ionizing source, and 2) provide a measurement of the circumstellar H_2 and HI, which - added to the mass of the central star and of the ionized shell- allows us to test theoretical initial-final mass relations, and to put together a complete picture of the star's evolution.
D037|4| | |Smith, M.|The Catholic University of America|BW Vul is a beta Cep star with an extraordinarily strong radial pulsation. It shows attributes of two shocks during its cycle: the first during the emergence of a pulsation wave and the second as a result of its nearly free-fall return. Each of these causes local heating. IUE studies have demonstrated that the primary shock can be observed in resonance lines moving outward through the wind for half a period. We propose FUSE observations of the star to follow the response of both photospheric and wind lines of many ions through a pulsation cycle. These time-serial spectra will constitute the first to be analyzed for the response of both photospheric and wind lines to a shock in any beta Cep star. The data will be analyzed using a progressively more sophisticated series of atmospheric models.
D039|4| | |Hoopes|The Johns Hopkins University|Galactic scale superwinds have an important impact on the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium. However, the full extent of their influence is still in question, due to the lack of information on the ``coronal'' phase in the wind. Emission from this 10^5 - 10^6 K gas may dominate the cooling in the superwind, and thereby determine the evolution of the wind and its ability to deposit mass and energy into the intergalactic medium. We propose to observe O VI 1032, 1038 Angstrom emission from the coronal gas in the energetic outflow from NGC 3079. With these observations we will determine the cooling rate of the coronal gas. This will allow us to determine whether cooling strongly affects the dynamical evolution of the winds. We will also investigate the kinematics of the gas in the wind. Comparison of O VI emission with optical emission lines from warm gas and X-ray emission from hot gas will illuminate the physical processes that create the coronal gas, which will constrain the dynamical evolution of the wind. Together with our Cycle 3 observations of O VI emission in the M82 outflow and previous O VI absorption measurements in other starbursts, this project will provide much new information about the physics of superwinds.
D040|4| | |Skillman|University of Minnesota|Nearby dwarf galaxies offer an unique opportunity to study the multiphase ISM at high resolution.  Of special interest are those galaxies which exhibit starburst activity, as they may represent nearby analogs to the star-forming galaxies seen in large numbers at higher redshifts.  These objects display a complicated interplay of ISM phases, with molecular, neutral, ionized and coronal gases each tracing a different component or consequence of the star formation process.  The high spectral resolution of FUSE in the vacuum UV provides the unique opportunity to study each of these phases simultaneously in relatively nearby galaxies.  We therefore propose a deep FUSE integration of the Sculptor Group dwarf starburst galaxy NGC625.  In particular we will study the coronal gas content and kinematics using the OVI 1032, 1038 Angstrom doublet in absorption, and the diffuse molecular component using the absorption lines of H_2 in the Lyman-Werner bands.  These data will be compared with ground-based and HST optical imaging, XMM-NEWTON x-ray imaging and spectroscopy, high-resolution radio data, and forthcoming SIRTF mid-IR spectroscopy in a detailed multiwavelength study of this paradigm starburst galaxy.
D041|4| | |Mathur|The Ohio State University|By virtue of their extreme properties, narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) have given us crucial leverage on the key physical parameters underlying the AGN phenomenon (\.m and $M_{BH}$).  There is also suggestive evidence of super-solar abundance in some NLS1s, possibly as a result of rapid nuclear star formation in the early/rejuvenated phase of galaxy evolution. Our goal is to measure accurately the metallicity in a carefully selected NLS1 with high resolution X-ray, UV and FUV spectroscopy. We propose to observe with FUSE Mrk~1044 for which we have been awarded Chandra and HST time. FUSE  will provide the crucial FUV range with observations of OVI, NIII and CIII. With these observations, we not only have a longer baseline in ionization stage, we also observe the crucial metallicity-sensitive nitrogen and oxygen lines. The combined X-ray, UV and FUV analysis will break the degeneracy between metallicity and ionization correction.  This is not only important for understanding the NLS1 phenomenon, but also for investigating evolutionary aspects of active galactic nuclei.
D042|4| | |Szkody|University of Washington|Among the approximately 100 new Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) currently found inthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are 2 systems that are optically bright (about 15.5 mag in V) and show evidence of a hot continuum and high excitation emission lines of HeII. We will use FUSE to obtain the first UV spectra in order to characterize the white dwarf temperatures and compositions as well as the source of the remaining UV light (accretion column or boundary layer). Both objects show large variability on timescales of hours and stand out among the usual low mass transfer rate CVs being found by SDSS. Analysis of the FUSE spectra of these bright objects, in combination with the line and continuum variations throughout their binary orbits, will enable us to parameterize the accretions areas in these likely magnetic systems.
D044|4| | |Moffat|Universite de Montreal|All hot, luminous stars emit copious X-rays.  However, the origin of the X-rays remains uncertain.  The most likely scenario is that they essentially arise in regions of very hot shocked gas associated with radiatively driven instabilities throughout the winds.  At the same time, variable subpeaks are observed on optical emission lines, that suggest the winds consist of a large number of stochastic clumps, probably following a size distribution dictated by compressible turbulence.  Are the X-ray shocks and the clumps related?  We propose to unveil the possible link between the hot shocked gas seen in X-rays and the wind clumping seen in optical emission lines by searching for variable structures in the O VI 1032, 1038 Angstrom emission feature,  which must arise in superionization conditions related to the X-ray regions.  We plan to monitor one carefully pre-selected target, a luminous hot star known to show a highly variable, structured wind - the single Wolf-Rayet star WR135 = HD 192103.  This should lead to far greater understanding of the fundamental processes operating in hot-star winds.  Failure to reveal the link will provide a challenge to current ideas on the variable substructures seen in virtually all hot-star winds.
D047|4| | |Brown, A.|University of Colorado, Boulder|We will obtain 30 ksec FUSE spectra of five A and F supergiants (spectral types A8 Ib to F8 Ib) that sample a section of the H-R diagram that is poorly explored in the FUV and UV, but which is crucial for understanding the causes of stellar activity and the role of mass loss on the evolution of massive stars. Previous FUSE spectra of the F0 Ib star Canopus provided excellent line profiles for transition region emission lines such as O VI and C III; profiles for similar lines in the UV are difficult to obtain due to the bright continuum. The proposed FUSE spectra will allow study of stellar activity indicators and the search for wind diagnostics; thus establishing whether the unusal properties of Canopus are typical of A/F supergiants.
D049|4| | |Blair|The Johns Hopkins University|We will observe an sdOB star behind the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant to study the line-of-sight interstellar medium structures toward and through  this prototypical remnant.  The star was identified from Ultraviolet  Imaging Telescope UV imaging and lies behind the bright NE Cygnus Loop  filaments. New ground-based data and a preliminary FUSE Cycle 3 spectrum  (program C052) demonstrate conclusively that the star is behind the supernova remnant.  This is the first FUV background source known for the Cygnus Loop.  We will re-observe this star to obtain improved signal-to-noise ratio data, and will also observe optically-emitting filaments directly adjacent, making a combined emission-absorption line study of the region possible. These two nearly complementary ways of studying the same region will provide the most detailed look to date at the workings of the Cygnus Loop blast wave as it encounters an interstellar cloud.
D054|4| | |Tripp|Princeton University Observatory|The sight line to the AGN Mrk205 ($z_em = 0.071$) penetrates the foreground spiral galaxy NGC4319 ($z = 0.0043$) at a projected distance of 4 kpc from the galaxy center. The sight line also pierces a compact high-velocity cloud (CHVC) in the Milky Way halo or Local Group. Using absorption lines in the Mrk205 spectrum, we propose to study the metal enrichment, physical conditions, and gas kinematics in these contrasting objects. FUSE is crucial for this purpose because the unsaturated H~I, O~I, and N~I lines are all in the FUSE bandpass, as well as the best tracers of low-density, ionized gas, e.g., O~VI and C~III. With this observation, we will (1) Measure absolute abundances. The spiral galaxy and the CHVC have vastly different overdensities, and their metallicities provide a useful discriminant of enrichment theories. (2) Measure relative abundances to constrain the stellar populations that contribute to the enrichment. (3) Compare refractory species (e.g., Fe and Al) to non-refractory elements (e.g., O) to constrain the absorber's dust content. (4) Compare the high ions to the neutral gas tracers to search for highly-ionized outflows and/or evidence of interactions with an ambient medium.
D055|4| | |Bowen|Princeton University Observatory|It is possible that galaxy groups contain a substantial fraction of the expected baryons in the local universe, some of which should be detectable as intragroup gas. Gas within the group should have been shock-heated to temperatures of 10^{5-7}K as the group collapsed, cooler than the X-ray emitting material found in giant clusters, and possibly in a multiphase form. We propose observing several QSOs and AGN whose sightlines pass within 1.7~h-1 Mpc of nearby groups of galaxies, in order to search for OVI (and corresponding Lyman-beta CIII and/or NII) absorption lines from the intragroup medium surrounding the constituent galaxies. Two of the selected groups are known to have extended X-ray emission from ROSAT observations, the rest have only upper limits to the X-ray flux.  Searching for absorption from _nearby_ groups is particularly useful since the environment, properties, and composition of the group can be more easily determined than at higher redshift.
D058|4| | |Vidal-Madjar|IAP - CNRS|Deuterium abundance measurements can be used to constrain the  Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the baryonic content of the Universe,  and the chemical evolution of galaxies. Such measurements in a  variety of astrophysical environments are one of the main  objectives of FUSE.  Since HI, OI, and DI have nearly the same ionization potential,  the D/O ratio is an important clue to the D/H ratio and its putative  variations. D/O is indeed very sensitive to astration, both because  of DI destruction and OI production. The first FUSE results on the  interstellar abundance of deuterium have showed that it is likely  that the D/H and D/O ratios have both a single value in the local  interstellar medium, but that they may present spatial variations  beyond the Local Bubble. However, the reduced size of the sample of  lines of sight analyzed so far does not allow definitive conclusions  to be drawn.  We selected 2 targets which were already observed with the FUSE large  apperture. Long MDRS observations of them will allow us to perform  accurate DI, NI, and OI mesurements. That will increase the number of  abundance measurements beyond the Local Bubble, in the context  of understanding the relationship between D, N, O, and H.
D059|4| | |Barstow|University of Leicester|Far UV images covering about 5% of the sky, obtained with the FAUST telescope, have detected several thousand UV sources. Many of these are associated with readily identifiable stellar sources. However, in more than 30 examples, there is a strong excess of UV flux compared what would be expected from the apparent identification. The most likely explanation of this excess is that these otherwise normal stars have a hidden hot subluminous companion, probably a white dwarf. We propose to obtain FUSE spectra of a sample of the UV excess objects detected by FAUST to confirm (or not) the present of a white dwarf companion. We will also include in our sample 3 stars identified to be binaries astrometrically, by Hipparcos, which have suspected white dwarf components. From comparison of the Lyman series lines with synthetic spectra, we will be able to measure the temperature and surface gravity in each case and ultimately determine the white dwarf mass. This will dramatically extend the sample of systems for which we have accurate white dwarf masses.
D064|4| | |Sonnentrucker|The Johns Hopkins University|Cl I and Cl II exhibit absorption transitions exclusively in the far  ultraviolet and were, hence, first detected with the Copernicus and IUE  satellites. A few surveys were carried out to better constrain empirically  the oscillator strengths of those newly detected lines, study the abundance  of this species in the ISM and search for depletion but large uncertainties  remain. We propose to determine empirically the f-value of the Cl I lines  using 8 low-to-highly reddened stars. We will derive the column density of  Cl I, Cl II and H2 and estimate the chlorine abundance for our star sample.  We will test whether the correlation found between Cl I, Cl II, H I and H2  for low-to-moderately reddened stars extends to the higher reddening  accessible to FUSE. We recently showed that chlorine plays an important role  in the search for translucent components along often complicated lines of  sight. We will, therefore, use our measurements to search for these  components, constrain their local molecular fractions and search for  depletions, expected in those components.
D065|4| | |Grady|Eureka Scientific|Spatially resolved spectroscopy of several Herbig Ae stars at Lyman alpha has demonstrated that these stars drive collimated, bipolar outflows through much of their pre-main sequence evolution, and therefore closely resemble young solar-mass T Tauri stars. For those objects, the stellar magnetic field is important in channelling material accreting onto the star and in collimating the outflow. Older A stars, in general, do not exhibit X-ray emission or FUV emission lines indicating the presence of stellar activity associated with a magnetic field, but recent FUSE observations of beta Pic indicate that such activity persists into at least the early phases of an A star's main sequence lifetime. At present we do not know the frequency, duration of such activity, nor do we know whether activity signatures are enhanced in systems with protoplanetary or debris disks compared to coeval stars lacking disks. These are the questions we will address by supplementing the current FUSE archival holdings of actively accreting Herbig Ae stars and the brightest debris disk systems with observations of older Herbig Ae stars, and a  suite of comparison A stars which are members of nearby stellar associations with secure age measurements.

However, the reduced size of the sample of lines of sight analyzed  so far does not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn. We propose  here a survey of targets located outside the Local Bubble, in order to  select good candidates for deuterium measurements. The final goal is to  perform long exposures of the selected targets during Cycle 5.
D071|4| | |Gansicke|University of Southampton|Cataclysmic variables (CVs) represent an important class of close interacting white dwarf + K/M dwarf binaries which routinely serve as astrophysical laboratories for the study of accretion discs and of plasma phyiscs at extreme temperatures and B-fields. However, it is precisely the accretion-related emission in CVs which makes accurate measurements of their binary parameters extremely difficult - and without the detailed knowledge of fundamental properties, such as their stellar masses, our understanding of the evolution of CVs is severely limited. Post Common Envelope Binaries (PCEBs), close but detached white dwarf/late type star binaries, will eventually evolve into CVs through the loss of angular momentum. The absence of mass transfer in these systems permits to determine their binary parameters at a level of precision unachievable in CVs, and measuring these parameters for an ensemble of PCEBs holds great potential for improving the theory of close binary evolution. Here, we propose to observe with FUSE four PCEBs (HR Cam, LM Com, RX J2130.3+4709, and KPD 2154+4048) in order to derive the effective temperatures, masses, photospheric abundances, and rotation rates of their white dwarf primaries.
D073|4| | |Lauroesch|Northwestern University|We will obtain high signal-to-noise ratio FUSE observations of the interstellar neutral fluorine absorption lines at 951 and 954 Angstroms toward the star HD103779 in order to determine an accurate gas-phase abundance of fluorine.  The nucleosynthetic source(s) of fluorine are still a matter of debate -- the present day abundance of fluorine can potentially constrain models for pulsationally driven dredge-up in asymptotic giant branch stars. An accurate measure for the depletion behavior of fluorine will determine whether it may be detectable in quasar absorption line systems -- an unambiguous detection of fluorine at suitably high redshifts would provide the best evidence to date for the neutrino process in massive stars.  Furthermore, due to its extreme reactivity, measurement of the gas-phase interstellar fluorine abundance is important for models of gas and grain chemistry. Despite the importance of measuring the interstellar fluorine abundance, only one previous detection has been made due to the low relative abundance of fluorine, the lack of lines outside the far-ultraviolet, and blending of the available transitions with lines of molecular hydrogen. The detection (or stringent upper limits) on the strength of the weaker 951 Angstrom line is essential in determining an accurate fluorine abundance.
D075|4| | |Ayres|University of Colorado, Boulder|FUSE observations of the ultra-fast rotating Hertzsprung gap  giant FK Comae (G5 III; v-sin-i= 160 km/s) will exploit the  phenomenon of super-rotational broadening to test whether such  stars have extended co-rotating regions of 100,000 K subcoronal  gas.  Extended emission zones are expected in a magnetospheric  scenario that describes a possible fundamental dramatic change  in magnetic activity as rapidly evolving moderate-mass giants  first enter the convective part of the H-R diagram.  A 15 ks  exposure will obtain moderate S/N profiles of O VI 1032 and  C III 977, suitable to test the super-rotation hypothesis.
D076|4| | |Lee|MIT Center for Space Research|We propose a 50~ks FUSE observation of the Seyfert~1 galaxy Markarian~290 to overlap with some portion of the  planned 250~ks  Chandra HETGS observation in spring/early summer 2003.  Such an observation will allow us to resolve the kinematics and ionization states of both the X-ray and UV absorbers in this source, and search for any kinematic (in)consistencies.The proposed simultaneous look will provide the necessary information for assessing the relationship and location of these absorbers.  We will additionally search for possible O VI absorption which may be attributable to the ``missing'' baryons found in the warm-hot component of the intergalactic medium.
D078|4| | |Sankrit|The Johns Hopkins University|Knot D, one of six X-ray features outside the boundary of the Vela supernova remnant, is believed to be a bow shock driven by a fragment of supernova ejecta (though a Chandra spectrum showing normal abundances casts doubt on the nature of the driver).  The emission at the edge of Knot D is broadly stratified - there are optical filaments along the edge, but separated from the brightest X-ray emission by a gap of about one arcminute.  Such a gap has not been seen in any other supernova remnant shock, and is most likely the consequence of the physics of bow shock dynamics.  The region, in between optical and X-ray emitting gas and therefore likely to have intermediate properties is best explored in the far-ultraviolet. We propose a set of four observations to study the temperature structure, the kinematics and the shock velocity variation in Knot D. We will observe three regions (optical, the gap, and X-ray) near the edge and one position farther behind the apex.  We will use the C III (low ionization) and O VI (high ionization) emission detected by FUSE to obtain the progression of properties of the emitting gas.  The observations will allow us to study the dynamics of an evolving bow shock.  Bow shocks are frequently invoked in the interpretation of emission from a range of objects such as jets from young stars and active galaxies, and Knot D presents an example of a simpler case when the shock is non-radiative over most of its surface.
D079|4| | |Massa|SGT, Inc|We intend to use FUSE observations to determine temperature variations  of a Slowly Pulsating B star throughout its pulsation cycle.  Precise  measurements of the temperature changes are essential for interpreting  the optical observations of this important class of objects which are  potential candidates for astro-seismology studies.  We demonstrate that  for late B stars, the FUSE wavelength band provides a sensitive and  robust temperature diagnostic that is unavailable at any other wavelength.To determine the best star to monitor, we require single observations of  four potential targets.
D080|4| | |Howell|Planetary Science Institute|V405 Aur is one of a small class of Intermediate Polars (IPs) which show strong, soft X-ray emission, have properties of both IPs and Polars, and are likely to evolve into AM Herculis stars (Polars), within a short astronomical time.  Decomposition of PQ Gem (the brightest member) has identified three or more spectral components and the modulations of these components (both the lines and continuum) phase with the white dwarf spin period, the binary orbital period, and the beat period between these two.  ORFEUS observations of PQ Gem provided the first look into the FUV spectral range but were too brief (0.4 of the orbit) to allow detailed analysis. However, strong FUV line emission (C, He, and O) was observed as well as complex line behavior probably related to the WD spin interaction with the partial accretion disk. We propose here to obtain the first detailed time-resolved FUV observations of the second brightest member of this small sub-class of objects, V405 Aur.
D081|4| | |Bergin|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to use FUSE to determine the Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field between 912-1100A in the GM Auriga proto-planetary disk system.These data will be combined with already allocated HST observations that will  characterize the FUV field for lambda > 1100A.  GM Aur is among a handful of sources that can be subjected to detailed  chemical studies with the current generation of millimeter-wave instruments. Such studies have found that the disks have a rich molecular chemistry, which  appears to be controlled by the FUV radiation field (Qi 2001; Dutrey et al 1997; Kastner et al 1997). These observations will allow a firm characterization of the full FUV radiation field impinging on the surfaces of circumstellar disks. Knowledge of the FUV field allows for more realistic theoretical chemical models to be constructed and compared to observations. Since a handful of objects will remain, for some time, the main templates for chemical studies of extra-solar disks, this project will provide the real UV data  required to push theory forward.  Given that molecules are excellent probes of their environment, the  new information will place better constraints on the virtually unknown  vertical structure of proto-planetary disks.  This project is unique in scope and will increase our limited understanding of disk chemical evolution, in addition to improving our knowledge of uncertain physical processes, such as the possible dissipation of outer disks by photo-evaporation and the timescales of dust grain growth.
D088|4| | |St-Louis|Universite de Montreal|We propose to secure a time sequence of ultraviolet (UV) spectra for the 14.9-day WC4+O5-6 LMC binary Brey 22 to study the structure of the bow shock zone formed when the winds of the two hot stars collide.  This will lead to constraints on orbital parameters and on characteristics of the WR star itself. Of particular importance in the FUSE wavelength range is the presence of a broad spread of emission lines with different ionization potentials, ranging from OVI to CIII.These lines are expected to arise in the bow-shock zone at progressively larger distances from the X-ray heated bow-shock head as the compressed plasma flows outward along the shock-cone and cools.  The study of how these lines vary with orbital phase will allow us to map out the structure and kinematics of the bow shock.  This in turn will provide useful constraints on the basic parameters of the winds as well as the collision process itself.  Brey 22 is a particularly good example of a system in which wind-wind collision effects are known to be strong. Among the 5 WC/WO+O binaries observable with FUSE in the Galaxy and the Magelanic Clouds, this is the last one to be examined. We will compare its behavior with our data already obtained for the other four systems.  By examining a limited number of binaries with different WC types and different orbital separations, we will be able to test how the wind-wind collision process depends on wind density, speed and ionization state.
D089|4| | |Dinerstein|University of Texas at Austin|We propose to obtain FUSE observations of planetary nebula central stars of the WC Wolf-Rayet ([WC]) class, in order to  search for the products of neutron-capture processes in these stars and provide constraints on their evolutionary status. Although the origin of the [WC]'s is controversial, their H-deficient, C-rich surface compositions indicate that they have experienced a high degree of mixing and/or mass loss. Thus one might expect the nebulae they produce to show enhanced concentrations of He-burning and other nuclear products, suchas nuclei produced by slow neutron capture during the AGB phase. We have already detected an absorption line from one such  element, Germanium (Sterling, Dinerstein, & Bowers 2002),  while conducting a search for H2 absorption from nebular molecular material FUSE GI programs A085 and B069). Since the strongest Ge enhancements were found in PNe with  [WC] central stars, we propose to enlarge the sample of such objects observed by FUSE.  THIS TEMPORARY AND PARTIAL SCRIPT COVERS ONE TARGET, HE 2-99, AND REQUESTS AN EXPOSURE TIME OF 15 KSEC. PHASE 2 INFORMATION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PROGRAM'S TOTAL TIME ALLOCATION OF 60 KSEC WILL BE SUBMITTED AT A LATER TIME.
D092|4| | |Holberg|Lunar and Planetary Laboratory|HS1136+6646 is a recently discovered close binary system consisting of a hot Teff ~120,000 K DAO white and a K6V main sequence primary. It is unique in being a relatively bright nearby example of both a very young post-common envelope system and a pre-cataclysmic variable system.  Although the system has been well observed from the ground, the white dwarf can only be effectively studied, from space, at UV wavelengths. We propose extended FUSE observations of the HS1136+6646 which focus on the nature of the white dwarf, its mass, temperature, photospheric composition and possible magnetic field.  Observations covering the entire 0.83607 day period orbital of the system will provide the first accurate determination of the velocity curve for the hot DAO white dwarf and hence the system mass ratio.  A photometric time series from these same observations will help establish the hypothesis that the low amplitude modulations seen in the optical light curve are associated with the rotation of the white dwarf.
D098|4| | |Blair|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose FUSE observations of a select set of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud to build on and improve earlier work in significant ways. A set of 22 stars has been pared to 12 in Phase 2 to fit into the TAC  allocation. We propose 6 new sight lines in close proximity to previously  observed stars to provide more detailed sampling of coherent sub-structures in the LMC such as bubbles or shells.  A set of 4 sight lines to stars in the previously unobserved superbubble N70 will provide a detailed study of this region. Also, building on our earlier detailed analyses of LMC sightlines, we will re-observe 2 objects whose current LWRS aperture data sets are contaminated by nearby stars and are useless for ISM work. Using MDRS will isolate the stars of interest and will provide ``new'' sight lines in the important 30 Doradus region. Observing these  new sight lines will leverage the much larger LMC data set by providing  better studies of ISM sub-structures.
D099|4| | |Redfield|University of Colorado at Boulder|FUSE, STIS, and Chandra observations show that plasma heated to temperatures of 10^4 K to > 10^6 K is present in the outer atmospheres of late-type dwarf stars including the late-A type stars. Aside from the detection of coronae in late-A stars and the emission rates from these hot plasmas, we  know very little about their structure and heating mechanisms. FUSE has the  unique capability to provide new information on both of these two questions.  FUSE can Doppler image rapidly rotating late-A stars in lines of C III and  O VI. If the hot plasma is located primarily in bright active regions, then  the shapes of these emission lines will change with time as the active  regions rotate on to one limb and off of the other limb. The existence of  active regions will tell us unambiguously that the hot plasma is  magnetically confined and magnetically heated, rather than heated by  acoustic waves. Our target is Altair, for which existing FUSE spectra  of the O VI and C III emission lines have a horned appearance, indicating  that emission near the limbs can be resolved due to the rapid rotation of  the star. We propose to observe Altair through multiple rotational periods.
D101|4| | |Allard|IAP - CNRS|Quasi-molecular satellites are due to transitions which take place during collisions of the radiating hydrogen atom and a perturbing atom or ion. These spectral features provide an important source of opacity in the DA white dwarf atmospheres in the red wings of Lyman series lines. From theoretical profiles it can be predicted that both H2 and  H2+ satellites of the Lyman-alpha and Lyman-beta lines should be  detectable in a small range of temperature (between 14000K to 11000K).  We will observe two variable DA in the ZZ Ceti range. The spectra of  these stars should allow us to detect the H2+ quasi-molecular features  at 1060A and 1080A, and, for the first time, a broad H2 quasi-molecular  feature at 1150A, a spectral region being studied in concurrent  laboratory experiments. In combination with existing optical and  ultraviolet data, they will allow us to determine accurate stellar  parameters for these stars which are among the few white dwarfs  defining the blue edge of the ZZ Ceti instability strip. These stars  will be the coolest white dwarfs observed by FUSE so far, will extend  our understanding of Lyman line profiles, and will provide insights  crucial in the modeling of cool white dwarf atmospheres.
D103|4| | |Howk|University of California San Diego|We will observe two moderate-redshift (z=0.574, 0.631) quasars o study the physical state of warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) absorbers using EUV transitions redshifted into the FUSE bandpass.  We will measure the column densities of multiple ionization states of oxygen (O II, O III, O IV, and O V) complementing HST observations of O VI), as well as of the very highly-ionized species Ne VIII and Mg X in intervening IGM absorbers along these three sight lines.  We will model the ionization balance of these systems to determine the extent to which they are affected by photoionization and, therefore, whether they represent the shock-heated WHIM predicted by the simulations or simply trace the metal-enriched Lyman-alpha forest.  We will also investigate the connection between WHIM absorbers and large-scale galaxy structures by combining our FUSE observations with galaxy redshift measurements obtained using DEIMOS on Keck and the WFCCD at Las Campanas Observatory.
D107|4| | |Lobel|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to observe the bright F-type Iab supergiant Beta Dor,to investigate and model the wind acceleration physics and thermal  structure of transition region plasma in the extended outer atmosphere  of this unique star. This investigation will provide important clues  about the acceleration mechanisms that drive the high-temperature  supersonic winds of cool supergiant stars. Previous FUSE observations  of the early G-type hybrid supergiant Alpha Aqr (G2 Ib), and HST-STIS  observations of Beta Aqr (G0 Ib) show evidence for the formation of  P Cygni-type profiles in high-temperature transition region plasma  emission lines of C III 977 A, C IV 1551 A, and Si III 1206 A.  Our semi-empirical non-LTE radiative transfer modeling reveals that  in Alpha Aqr the C III 977 A line forms in a supersonic transition  region wind, which quickly accelerates above the upper chromosphere,  with a steep increase of the kinetic gas temperature into the lower  transition region. The model indicates outflow velocities above ~140  km/s at temperatures of 65,000 K and higher. Asymmetric O VI resonance  emission lines in Alpha Aqr and Beta Dra (G2 Ib-II) reveal substantial  scattering opacity in the upper transition region. FUSE observations  of Beta Dor (F6) will reveal if the wind acceleration mechanism at  high atmospheric temperatures is correlated with the larger effective  temperatures of F-type supergiants, and if so, demonstrate the  importance of the radiative wind driving mechanism with detailed  radiative transfer fits in spherical geometry to the C III 977 A (and  O VI) line(s). The proposed FUSE observations offer a unique opportunity  to constrain the outflow dynamics and thermal structure of transition  region plasma above the chromospheres of F supergiants. These  observations are important for studies of heatings mechanisms at  very high atmospheric temperatures and the related mass-loss  mechanisms, which play a crucial role for the evolution of late-type  stars.
D108|4| | |Redfield|University of Colorado at Boulder|FUSE spectra of active late-type stars contain the Fe XVIII 974 A coronal  emission line. The spectral resolution and wavelength scale (relative to nearby  interstellar absorption lines) of FUSE permit us to measure the line width and  velocity shift of this coronal emission line, providing a new window on stellar  coronal dynamics and structure. We propose to use this new tool to measure the  widths and Doppler shifts of the Fe XVIII line in rapidly rotating stars. In a  survey of coronal emission lines observed in late-type stars by FUSE,  Redfield et al. (2002) found that the Fe XVIII line width is thermal for slowly  rotating stars, but for rapidly rotating stars the line is much broader than  predicted given thermal and rotational broadening at the photospheric value of  v sin i.  They proposed that the extra width of the Fe XVIII lines in the  rapidly rotating stars is due to geometrically extended coronae rigidly rotating with the star.  However, the available line profiles are very noisy, and this  important new tentative result must be confirmed by deeper observations of the  previously observed stars.
D109|4| | |Barrett|Space Telescope Science Institute|Eclipsing polars have long provided important information about the structure and dynamics of magnetic cataclysmic variables (mCVs) by providing precise information about the location of the emitting gas within the binary system. Previous such studies have shown that the X-ray and FUV (S III, S IV, Si IV, O VI) emission lines are located on or very near the white dwarf surface, while the optical and near-UV emission lines are predominantly from the surface of the secondary star.  However, EUV and FUV observations of some eclipsing CVs show these emission lines to be present throughout the eclipse, indicating a third location for the EUV and FUV emission lines that is displace from the two stars.  We propose phase-resolved observations of several eclipsing polars to better understand the far UV emission in these binaries.  The combination of eclipse mapping and doppler tomography will enable us to make detailed maps of the accretion stream and to better understand the location of the EUV and FUV line emission regions.
D113|4| | |Dufour|Rice University|Of-type emission line stars are thought to represent a short-lived phase in the evolution of massive stars, intermediate between the main sequence and Wolf-Rayet stages.  The increase in wind luminosity affects not only the mechanical input into the star's surroundings, but presumably the shape of the stellar ionizing continuum.  Observations of these relatively rare stars provide valuable insight into the post-main sequence evolution of massive stars and the impact on their environments. One peculiar subclass of Of stars exhibits, in the morphology of its emission lines, the hallmarks of both rapid rotation and a strong stellar wind.  Designated as Oef, one member of this stellar type is BD+60 2522, whose UV flux ionizes the HII region NGC 7635 (S 162).  The ram pressure of the wind has swept nearby material from the HII region interior into a spherical bubble.  In addition, there are complexes of knots in proximity to the star; images of the region imply an area of strong interaction between the stellar wind and the photoevaporative flow from the closest of the knots.  We propose to observe BD+60 2522 with FUSE to better determine the stellar and wind parameters of the star and the corresponding impact on its local environment, using a unified model atmosphere code already developed.
D114|4| | |Long|Space Telescope Science Institute|We propose to use the unique capabilities of FUSE to explore the time-dependent behavior of the bipolar outflow of the low-inclination, nova-like cataclysmic variable V592 Cas. Our previous FUSE monitoring of the nova-like system RW Sex revealed extensive variability in the UV resonance lines,  entirely confined to blue-shifted velocities, and modulated on a time-scale close to the system orbital period.  This surprising result implies that the outflow in RW Sex is not axisymmetric with respect to the disk plane! V592 Cas has optical emission lines that suggest wind line variability similar to RW Sex. However, unlike RW~Sex, V592 Cas has been studied carefully using time-resolved optical photometry, resulting in the discovery of permanent negative superhumps. This is a sure sign of a warped, precessing accretion disk in this system. By observing V592 Cas on three occasions, we propose to establish that the wind in V592 Cas varies on near orbital time-scales and then to determine whether the asymmetry in the wind is associated with the superhump asymmetry or phenomena, e.g. a disk-stream interaction, that would be expected to produce wind variations at precisely vary the orbital period.
D115|4| | |Ayres|University of Colorado, Boulder|A 100 ks FUSE pointing will probe the O VI and C III emissions of an archetype denizen of the coronal graveyard--Aldebaran  (Alpha Tauri; K5 III).  HST spectra suggest the  possible--surprising--presence of solar-like magnetic activity  on the old, spun-down red giant.  But, many of the characteristic  1150-1500 A UV emissions apparently are extinguished by a cool  absorber overlying the hot (100,000 K) structures.  Detection of  O VI by FUSE suggests that the cool absorber opacity thins out  just above the LyC edge, so O VI 1032 (and C III 977) could be a  sensitive probe of the submerged activity through the far-UV  opacity hole.  The deep pointing will achieve high S/N, to search  for discrete absorption structure in the hot lines, impressed on  them by the cool absorber; and will allow an assessment of temporal variability due to the heating process, which might be  convective-acoustic but probably is magnetic.  If the latter, the  buried magnetic activity on red giants possibly plays a key role in driving their winds--a long-standing astrophysical mystery, and a crucial component of galactic chemical evolution.  The existing  FUSE spectrum is too low in S/N to unambiguously measure discrete  absorption components, and its singular nature precludes any  variability analysis.
D117|4| | |Benjamin|University of Wisconsin-Madison|We propose to characterize the diffuse \OVI\ emission and absorption in  two directions where diffuse ultraviolet \CIV\ emission has already been  detected, near Mrk 153 ($l=155^{\circ}$, $b=58^{\circ}$) and 3C249.1  ($l=130^{\circ}$, $b=39^{\circ}$). The comparison of the \OVI\ emission  to absorption will constrain the density and pressure of the emitting  gas. The \OVI\  emission will also be compared with the detected \CIV\  1549 \AA\ line, as well as diffuse optical line emission (H$\alpha$,  [\SII],[\NII], [\OIII]) and broadband ROSAT X-ray emission. The  combination of these measurements will be used to diagnose whether the  emission arises in shocks, cooling zones, mixing layers, or conduction  fronts.  For Mrk 153, this observation will also allow us to confirm if  there is high velocity \OVI\ emission corresponding to the high  velocity  \OVI\ absorption known to exist along this line of sight. For  3C 249.1, the data will be combined with archival \CIV\ absorption data  from a 50 ksec HST STIS observation. This will allow us to determine the  density/pressure in \underline{both} the \CIV\ and \OVI\ emitting gas.  We will also use the absorption spectrum of 3C249.1 to  search for  intergalactic \OVI\ absorption in this $z=0.311$ quasar.
D118|4| | |Stocke|U of Colorado|We propose to investigate whether nearby spiral rich galaxy groups  are a significant reservoir of gas in the so-called  warm-hot  phase; i.e., collisionally-ionized gas at temperatures between 1.0e5 and 1.0e7 degrees.  Numerical simulations of intergalactic gas predict that this  warm-hot  phase gas could account for 40-60 percent of all baryons  locally, and yet HST/FUSE spectra have found a baryon fraction of only about 10 percent in O VI absorbers, which is the most viable  detection method for such gas.  Where might these  warm-hot  baryons be hiding?  One possibility is spiral rich groups of galaxies which  are very numerous, marginally bound, and which have been predicted to have intragroup gas at the right temperature to be O VI absorbers. In addition, spiral rich groups occupy a fractional volume small enough that they have not been probed extensively by current FUSE/HST observations. While this project was approved in FUSE Cycle 3, our two highest priority targets were not observed due to their low declinations. Here we target two high declination AGN (declination greater than +40) whose sightlines penetrate the very nearby M101 galaxy Group (cz = 250-500 km/s).
D120|4| | |Guerrero|Univ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|A planetary nebula (PN) is formed by the current fast stellar wind  sweeping up the previous slow wind.  The shocked fast wind is  over-pressurized and drives the nebular expansion.  X-ray observations  of PNe have revealed the shocked fast stellar wind in their interiors,  but the low temperatures of the X-ray-emitting plasma in PNe and the  low frequency of X-ray detections among PNe are puzzling.  It is  possible that some PN interiors are dominated by gas at temperatures  below 10^6 K.  To understand the physical conditions of PN interiors,  we need to investigate the 10^5 K gas in order to study the interface  between the hot interior and the cool nebular shell and to determine  whether 10^5 K gas is the dominant temperature component in the PN  interior.  The 3x10^5 K gas is best probed with the O VI 1032,1037 A  lines.  FUSE observations of the PN NGC 7009 have demonstrated that  it is easier to detect O VI in emission than in absorption.  We  propose an O VI emission line survey for a sample of 9 carefully  selected PNe.  These observations will reveal the content of 3x10^5 K  gas in their interiors and allow us to study the conduction fronts and  to select candidates for future X-ray observations.
D121|4| | |Chu|Univ of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Fast stellar winds sweep up ambient media to form bubbles.  The interior  of the dense swept-up shell of a bubble is filled with shocked fast wind  at high temperatures.  At the interface between the hot (10^7--10^8 K)  interior gas and the cool (10^4 K) swept-up shell, conduction lowers the temperature and mass evaporation raises the density of the hot interior  gas.  This conduction front plays an important role in determining the physical structure and evolution of a bubble.  Conduction fronts have  been previously studied via C IV, N V, O VI absorption lines with very  limited success.  No spatial information of the conduction front is  available in these absorption observations.  We request FUSE observations of the bubble S308 to search for O VI emission lines from the conduction layer in this bubble.  Our XMM observations of  S308 show limb-brightened diffuse X-ray emission; furthermore, comparison  between X-ray and optical images reveal a 90--140 arcsecond gap between the  outer edge of the X-ray emisison region and the optical shell rim.  This gap  provides vivid evidence of the existence of conduction fronts.  We request  FUSE LWRS observations of three positions in S308 to resolve the structure  of its conduction front.  The FUSE observations of the O VI emission lines,  together with the HST STIS observations of the C IV and N V absorption line  observations, will provide the most comprehensive views of a conduction  front and allow us to evaluate the efficiency of conduction.
D122|4| | |Christian|The Johns Hopkins University|The theory of stellar dynamos predicts that the distributed dynamo is at work in fully convective stars. The small scale fields generated in these objects affect the properties of their outer atmospheres. The present proposal will use FUSE spectra to derive the atmospheric parameters of the dM6e star Prox Cen, an object which is expected to be fully convective. The method of escape probabilities will be applied to line ratios of C III and O VI to derive optical depths and path lengths in the transition region. The path lengths and emission measure, will be combined with estimates of the electron density to determine the filling factors of the emission.
D123|4| | |Bennett|University of Colorado at Boulder|The proposed target stars (zeta Aur, 31 Cyg) are eclipsing binary systems with K supergiant primaries and B-type main sequence companions. From these binaries, we will determine key information about fundamental stellar parameters and outer atmospheric structure that can not be obtained from observations of single red supergiants. The proposed observations are directed towards understanding the  mass loss process driving the massive winds of red supergiants. In particular, the proposed FUSE observations will support the following analyses: -- detailed model atmosphere analyses of the B-stars' continua -- determining accurate radial velocities of the B-type secondaries -- analyses of the wind absorption features of the red supergiant primaries. From these FUSE observations, we will determine improved fundamental stellar  parameters of red supergiants (effective temperatures, radii, masses and  luminosities) and wind properties (velocity laws and mass loss rates).
D126|4| | |Dupree|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|FUSE spectra can provide the connecting link between the photosphere and corona of a rapidly rotating (12.4 hour) pre-main sequence star, AB Dor, to test quantitatively the magnetic models constructed with contemporaneous optical observations. Changes in far ultraviolet  flux and line profiles of O VI and C III with rotational phase in  this extreme atmosphere can signal the presence of closed and open magnetic fields, leading to enhanced emission or mass outflow. We expect sufficient signal in Fe XVIII to pinpoint the  source of  coronal emissions.  AB Dor is in the FUSE CVZ at the end of December 2003 when our contemporaneous optical observations are scheduled.  A continuous pointing totalling 90 ks will give 2 complete rotations of the star.
D127|4| | |McCandliss|The Johns Hopkins University|IC 405 and NGC 7023 are gas and dust rich interstellar regions known to exhibit the double-peaked emission feature near 1600Angstroms characteristic of fluorescent molecular hydrogen.  The exciting stars reside in very different environments.  AE Aur (Teff~34 kK) is a runaway star, while  HD 200775 (Teff~20 kK) is just emerging from its proto-stellar nebula.  We propose to exploit the high resolution capability of FUSE to observe the fluorescence process in the far UV where 70% of the fluorescence energy is emitted. From these observations we will determine the relative degree to which the population of the electronic ground state is influenced by the processes of fluorescence, shocks, formation pumping and multiple pumping.  These data will compliment our ongoing FUSE studies of fluorescent molecular hydrogen emission in diverse environments.
D131|4| | |Wannier|Jet Propulsion Laboratory-Caltech|The QSO 0045+3926 (IO And) sightline is intriguing from the perspective of  studying high-velocity gas in our Local Group.  It passes close to the Local  Group galaxy M31, and is about 15 degrees from material thought to be part of  the Magellanic Stream.  Exploratory FUSE observations (8 ksec, Cycle 2) have  revealed four kinematic components, a local one, two highly redshifted ones associated with the background quasar, and one high velocity component (blue- shifted) originating somewhere within our Local Group.  The high-velocity Local Group component shows H I, O VI and C III at a velocity consistent with that of  an extended M31 disk, or with that of gas tidally stripped from our own Galaxy. The existing FUSE observations have insufficient S/N to clearly establish the  origin or the composition of the high-velocity material.  We request longer observations, which will greatly improve our knowledge of the gas composition and kinematics.  Such observations will also improve our knowledge of the  foreground (Galactic) and background (QSO) material evident in the exploratory  observations.
D136|4| | |Bouret|LAM - CNRS|Herbig Ae/Be stars are pre-main sequence (PMS) stars of  intermediate mass. They present signs of intense activity, the  origin of which is not understood. Various speculations concerning  the origin of the FUV emission of these stars have been proposed.  They include processes involving stellar coronae and winds, massive  accretion of circumstellar material onto the stellar surface, or,  in the case of binary Ae/Be stars, coronal emission from low-mass,  possibly T Tauri star companions.  We wish to obtain FUV spectra of a sample of binary systems, which have not been studied previously, in order to assess the affects  of binarity on Ae/Be star activity. These new spectra will be supplemented by archival FUSE data which  we will use to build two other samples of Herbig stars; one sample of stars showing signs of massive accretion disks, the other with  stars exhibiting signatures of stellar winds. By comparing the three samples, we will study the  occurrence and the origin of high temperature regions in these stars.  More precisely, differences in detection rates, FUV luminosity  distribution and FUV line profiles between these three samples will  enable us to test the various interpretations outlined above.
D137|4| | |Dobbie|University of Leicester|We propose to obtain FUV spectroscopy of the DA white dwarf RE J0723-277. This will permit us to determine the column densities of ions such as ArI, CII, CIII, NI, NII, NIII and OI along the first ~ 100pc of the line of sight towards the DAO white dwarf RE J0720-318 (d ~ 188$pc), which has been observed previously by FUSE. The measurements of column densities towards both white dwarfs will be used, in conjunction with the limits placed on N(HI), N(HeI) and N(HeII) from EUVE data, to investigate further the origins of the large ionisation fractions found for the local interstellar medium in the direction of the CMa tunnel. In addition, as RE J0723-277 lies very close in the T_eff v log g plane to the DA GD394, which has a most peculiar pattern of photospheric heavy element abundances, we will use this observation to undertake a detailed analysis of the photospheric composition of the former in a bid to shed further light on the processes at play in the atmosphere of the latter.
D138|4| | |Peters|University of Southern California|FUSE observations of four sharp-lined early B main-sequence band stars in the Magellanic Clouds will be carried through to determine the abundances of the heavy elements, especially those of the Fe group. The FUSE spectral region contains numerous Fe III lines, including the resonance multiplet (UV1) near 1130 A that is excellent for abundance determinations and two strong multiplets of V III, an ion that does not produce measurable lines longward of 1200 A in metal-deficient stars. In addition there are several measurable lines from Cr III and Mn III. Although abundances of the Fe-peak elements are of interest because they are important for assessing opacities for stellar evolution calculations and the validity of theoretical calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis, ground-based studies do not yield this information because measurable lines from these species, except for a few Fe III lines, are found only in the UV spectral region. The abundances of heavy elements provide information on the production of such elements in previous generations of stars. From FUSE data obtained in Cycle 3 we are determining the abundances of the Fe group elements in two sharp-lined early B stars in the SMC (AV 304, a field star, and NGC346-637, a star in a mini-starburst cluster). This project will allow one to compare the abundances in AV 304 and NGC346-637 with those in the LMC and other regions in the SMC and look for asymmetry in heavy element production in the Magellanic Clouds.
D144|4| | |Godon|Villanova University|While IUE and HST provide ideal information on low temperature  (10,000-20,000K), White Dwarfs (WDs) and disks in Cataclysmic  Variables (CVs), the importance of FUSE lies in its ability to  study the hottest WDs and the inner disk. This high temperature  regime involves the higher accretion rate systems that are located  above the gap at periods longer than 3 hours. Unfortunately, only  a few such Novalike objects (in permanent high state of accretion)  have been observed, and only one spectrum was obatined in the far  UV with FUSE (MV Lyr).  We have chosen the Novalike system V794 Aql for which preliminary IUE studies show a hot white dwarf and inner  disk.  A comparison of the disk/WD in this systems with the low  accretion rate Dwarf Nova (DN) systems will provide important  constraints on the accretion limits for disk instability outbursts.  We will use the SYNSPEC/TLUSTY/TLUSDISK model code to characterize  the basic properties (such as Teff, log g, Vsini, chemical abundances,  accretion belts and evidence of past thermonuclear runaway) of the  WD accretors in Novalike systems.
D145|4| | |Sion|Villanova University|A major source of serious problems with the disk instability theory of dwarf nova outbursts is its inability to reproduce the behavior of dwarf novae during quiescence (Lasota 2002, Hameury 2002, Menou 2002). Most DN systems during quiescence behave contrary to theoretical predictions. Above the CV period gap, the state of the accretion disk (optically thick?) and properties of the central white dwarf (Teff, Vsini, log g, chemical abundances, signs of past TNRs?) remain largely unknown. Our FUSE and archival IUE studies show that the disk and white dwarf properties appear to vary greatly from system to system. In order to gain deeper insight into the cause of these differences from system to system and to increase the number of white dwarfs above the period gap with known properties beyond the mere four that we now have (U Gem, RX And, SS Aur, RU Peg), we propose FUSE investigations of four additional systems, EY Cyg, BV Cen, CH UMa and WW Ceti, all of which are excellent candidates for understanding the disk structure and white dwarfs/boundary layers during quiescence.
D146|4| | |Sion|Villanova University|We propose FUSE observations of 8 symbiotic binaries (red^M giant + white dwarf/accretion disk?) around superior spectroscopic^M conjunction when the accreting, hot component is in front of the red^M giant. The 8 systems were selected because they show no clear evidence of^M an accretion disk or nebular continuum shortward of 1800A and thus offer^M the opportunity to carry out the first NLTE synthetic spectral analyses of^M the hot components with high gravity photosphere models and accretion disk^M models with vertical structure. Our objectives are: (1) determine whether^M a disk is really absent and, if not, derive the accretion rate; (2)^M determine the first temperatures for the hot components, independent of^M past Zanstra techniques or black body fits; (3) determine the first^M rotation rates for the white dwarfs in these systems; (4) search for^M evidence of thermonuclear processing from the chemical abundance ratios of^M the mix of ionic absorption features identified with their photospheres;^M compare the properties (temperatures, rotation rates, abundances,^M accretion heating)  of this class of white dwarf wind or disk accreters^M with the properties of the accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic^M variables. ^M

D152|4| | |Iping|The Catholic University of America|We propose to obtain phase resolved FUSE observations of the high mass  X-ray binary, HD153919 /(4U1700-37).  The luminous O6.5 Iaf star eclipses the compact object with a 3.411581 day period. This system is unique and has unsolved problems that only FUSE can address. The compact object, a neutron star or a blackhole, ionizes the surrounding area and acts as a probe of the stellar wind as it moves through the binary orbit. We propose to obtain 4 time constrained  observations, at orbital phases 0.00, 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75. We will search for orbital modulations of the many stellar wind lines in  the FUSE band, due to the X-ray  photoionization of the wind. The so-called Hatchett & McCray effect, observed in several other HMXR binaries, has not been observed yet in HD153919 due to the fact that the wind is very dense, which saturates the NV, Si IV and  C IV lines in the UV longward of 1200 A. We need observations with FUSE ( 905-1187 A) where many of the lines are higher  excitation lines and/or are not saturated. Studying the line profile changes with orbital phase will provide detailed information  on the geometry and physical conditions of the X-ray ionized region and the  accretion flow near the compact X-ray source.
D153|4| | |Gizis|University of Delaware|We propose to make FUSE spectra of the massive binary SK-67D105 at six orbital phases.  This LMC binary (O4f + O6V) represents one of the most massive known binaries comprised of O-type stars, and the close proximity of the stars and the probable strengths of their stellar winds makes SK-67D105 an ideal target for a study of colliding winds in massive binaries.  The spectra would record the orbital phase variations in the strong wind lines found in the FUSE wavelength range, and would allow us to study the geometry of the colliding winds bow shock.  The ratios of lines of different ionization states will be especially useful for estimating temperature effects in the colliding winds.  We would also use the photospheric FUV lines to refine the orbital parameters, reconstruct the spectra of the individual components (using Doppler tomography), assign spectral types, and measure projected rotational velocities.  The investigation will yield important first results on colliding winds and stellar evolution in a massive binary system comprised of low metallicity O-stars.
D154|4| | |Arav|University of Colorado at Boulder|Our proposed FUSE observations are the last component of a deep X-ray/UV spectroscopy campaign on the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 279. In the current Chandra cycle, 360 ksec Chandra LETGS and 16 HST/STIS orbits have been approved for this project. Our main scientific goal is to study the AGN outflow seen as an ionized absorber in this galaxy, focusing on the crucial connection between the X-ray and UV manifestations of the outflows.  We will map the ionization and velocity structure, measure the elemental abundances and then determine the mass and kinetic luminosity flux of the outflow, all stepping stones for studying the importance of the outflows in the evolution of AGN and their host galaxies.  The combination of unblended outflow troughs, very low Galactic column (avoiding the plague of H_2 contamination) and very high UV flux, makes Mrk 279 the most promising of all AGN outflow targets in the FUSE band. In addition, the proposed FUSE observa tions will allow for a unique high-quality variability study of an AGN outflow, since we will have three epochs of excellent FUSE AGN outflow data (35-100 ks each) with simultaneous HST echelle data for two of these epochs.
D155|4| | |Gabel|Catholic University of America|NGC 5548 is an ideal target for a detailed study of mass outflow in  active galaxies.  This bright Seyfert 1 galaxy exhibits a rich absorption spectrum in the UV, far-UV, and X-ray, and has been one of the most  intensely studied AGNs for its absorption properties.  However, recent  studies have produced conflicting results concerning the level of  saturation in its UV absorption; hence the fundamental quantities that are measured in the absorbers, their column densities, remain uncertain. We have been awarded 20 orbits of observing time with HST/STIS to address this issue so that further progress can be made in understanding  the mass outflow in NGC 5548.  We propose a coordinated, deep exposure with  FUSE that will provide crucial results needed to obtain a definitive answer. The FUSE spectrum samples the full set of higher order Lyman lines, providing the tools needed to separate the individual line-of-sight covering  factors of the continuum and emission line sources.  Since the individual kinematic components of absorption are easily resolved with FUSE, the covering  factors can be solved at each velocity.  These results are critical for  measuring accurate column densities for many of the lines in the  far-UV -- UV bandpass and will provide unique constraints on the absorption  and emission geometry in the AGN.  Additionally, the far-UV spectral  coverage of FUSE samples numerous key lines that are needed to fully constrain the ionization state, effective column density, and  abundances in the absorbers.  The results obtained from this study will  provide a crucial step towards testing dynamical models of mass outflow in AGNs.
D156|4| | |Hartley|Space Telescope Science Institute|We propose to study the interacting binary star, QU Car, which may be the most luminous CV known and is certainly the first to show carbon overabundance in the secondary. We require the high time-resolution and spectral coverage of the FUSE satellite to probe the structure of this poorly understood system. We will measure the FUV spectral energy distribution and, from this, improve our calculation of the luminosity, which has already been shown to be close to the supersoft X-ray domain. From the unique combination of spectral lines available with FUSE we will calculate atomic abundances of C, N and O in the accretion disk. At time-resolutions of down to 100s we will measure the spectral line variability on timescales on the order of both the orbital period and the 2000s variability apparent in HST STIS-range spectral lines. We aim to examine the role of an outflow versus a high temperature disk in shaping the spectral characteristics of QU Car. In developing a better physical model of this apparently atypical system and establishing its relationship to other luminous binaries we seek to better understand the evolution of close binary systems.
D157|4| | |Dixon|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose FUSE observations of three hot (T_eff > 40,000 K) post-AGB stars in globular clusters with exposure times sufficient to achieve a single-channel signal-to-noise ratio of 25--30 per resolution element. The resulting data set will allow detailed studies of both the stars themselves and the intervening interstellar medium.  By comparing their FUSE spectra with synthetic spectra derived from non-LTE stellar atmosphere models, we will determine the stars' temperatures, surface gravities, and abundances, place them accurately on the HR diagram, and advance our understanding of the late stages of stellar evolution.  By modeling the absorption features of interstellar S III (1013 A), O VI (1032, 1038 A), and Fe III (1123 A), we will derive the mass and velocity distribution of both the warm and hot components of the Galactic halo along these lines of sight.  Besides answering our questions, these data will provide an important contribution to the FUSE archive.
D158|4| | |Napiwotzki|University Erlangen-Nuernberg|We have identified a binary white dwarf system (double-degenerate - DD) with an orbital period of 7h 12min and an estimated total mass of 1.45Msun (i.e. above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4Msun).  This system will merge within 4 Gyrs.  The confirmation of a DD which is massive enough and will merge within a Hubble time will have severe impact on the progenitor models of supernovae type Ia (SN Ia). This object was found in the ESO Supernovae Ia Progenitor surveY (SPY) which is carried out as Large Programme at the ESO Very Large Telescope. The remaining uncertainty concerns the mass of the secondary in this binary, which could be further constrained with our proposed FUSE observations. The proposed observations are critical to verify the total mass, which is close to the limit for a SN Ia in about 4 Gyrs. The needed accuracy can only be reached with the unique FUV capabilities provided by FUSE.  If the mass is confirmed, this would be the first known DD progenitor of a SN Ia.
D161|4| | |Fontaine|Universite de Montreal|We propose to measure the projected rotational velocity of KPD 1930+2752, a unique binary system consisting of a sdB primary undergoing acoustic mode pulsations and ellipsoidally distorted by the presence of an unseen white dwarf companion.  The orbital period of the system is 2.383 hrs.  The measurement of v sin i is the one datum currently missing that prevents us from modeling the ellipsoidal light curve in terms of the basic parameters of the two stellar components. Once this measurement is secured, we should be able to derive the values of the masses and radii of these two stars.  We should be able to verify if indeed KPD 1930+2752 is a genuine progenitor of a Type Ia supernova as was recently suggested by a British group.  More importantly, by combining the values of the mass and the radius of the sdB pulsator with the period data, we should be able to model, for the first time, the interior structure of a sdB star through asteroseismological techniques.  FUSE time tag observations are unique for this type of measurement.  They allow us to remove the star's orbital velocity (348 km/s) that inevitably smears out the photospheric lines.  We have already successfully implemented such a procedure in the CalFUSE pipeline.  The projected equatorial velocity, v sin i, is then determined by comparing the star's line profiles to computed rotation profiles.
D162|4| | |Heap|NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center|By confronting the effects of rotation, astronomers have come to the threshold of a major advance in understanding massive stars. Theoreticians have recently developed a new generation of evolutionary models that account for rotation, and  observers are starting to test these models. The SMC, a low-metallicity galaxy,  is an excellent environment for discerning the role of rotation  because of the  high initial rotational velocities and weak winds of its massive stars. In our  earlier FUSE+STIS+optical spectral analysis of O-type stars in the SMC (Heap et  al.2002), we found signatures of rapid rotation in the form of (1) a lower  effective gravity due to centrifugal force and (2) enrichment of atmospheric  nitrogen. We now propose to extend our study to B-type stars in the SMC in  order to include stars at later evolutionary phases. We expect that the  proposed FUSE observations will result in a robust calibration of the spectral  properties of B-type stars at low metallicity and that they will have important implications for understanding the precursors to core-collapse supernovae and  to the sources of nitrogen in the early universe.
D164|4| | |Iping|The Catholic University of America|FUSE observations have discovered narrow O VI 1032 and 1038 A emission  from supernova 1987A. The emission lines have FWHM < 30km/s.  The most plausible origin for this emission is the low-density remnant of the progenitor's stellar wind from its red supergiant phase.  This material is located inside the inner circumstellar ring and was highly ionized (O VI - O VII) by the supernova explosion in 1987. The emission today is the result of ongoing recombination in this gas. An alternative source for the O VI emission, the shock interaction regions of the supernova debris with the inner ring, was eliminated because other optical and UV emission lines from these hot spots have line widths in excess of 200 km/s.  We propose another observation of SN1987A in Cycle 4 to pursue two objectives. First, the evolution of the O VI emission from ionized gas  inside the ring holds important clues for the geometry and mass of this gas, and possibly the origin of the circumstellar rings.  Second, as the shock  interaction with the inner ring progresses, broad O VI emission is expected  to increase in strength.  We want to search for this emission in order to constrain the models for the debris-ring collision.
D165|4| | |Landsman|Science Systems and Application, Inc.|We propose to obtain FUSE spectra of the two binary sdB/O stars II-91 and D702 in the old, open cluster NGC188 in order to determine the fundamental parameters (T_eff, log g) and selected abundances.Although there are many existing FUSE observations of field sdB/O stars, there are no such observations  in an open cluster of known distance  (d=1700 pc), age (7 Gyr), metallicity ([Fe/H] = -0.04), and blue straggler fraction. The cluster metal abundance will provide  a baseline for understanding how the processes of radiative levitation and diffusion alter the surface abundances of sdB/O stars.More importantly,  II-91 and D702  provide the majority of ultraviolet flux from NGC 188, which is the nearest open  cluster with an integrated ultraviolet upturn similar to that observed in elliptical galaxies.Our FUSE observations will provide an opportunity to test binary and single-star evolutionary scenarios for the origin of the sdB/O stars, which are believed to be responsible for the UV-upturn.
D168|4| | |Wesemael|Universite de Montreal|The DB white dwarfs belong to the subgroup of white dwarf stars which possess an atmosphere dominated by helium. Their optical spectra are characterized by the transitions of neutral helium, and their effective temperatures range from 30,000 K to approximately 13,000 K. Trace elements are also occasionally seen in the atmosphere, principally hydrogen, but also a handful of heavy elements like calcium and carbon.  To explain the abundance patterns of both dominant and trace elements, several processes must be called upon, namely upward diffusion of hydrogen left over from previous evolutionary phases, downward settling of heavy elements, convective dredge-up from deeper layers, convective mixing, accretion from the ISM, radiative element support, etc ... However, previous observational studies, be they in the optical or in the ultraviolet (IUE, GHRS), only paint an incomplete picture of the abundance patterns of trace elements. We propose to secure spectra for five DB stars spanning the effective temperature range between 16,000 and 23,000 K with the specific aims of obtaining abundances of several elements (C, N, Fe, Si) and of testing the reliability of our model atmospheres in that wavelength range. The FUSE observations will provide us with a unique opportunity to study the competing physical processes which affect the photospheric abundance of heavy elements in DB stars.
D171|4| | |Fabian|University of Cambridge|X-ray observations of the gas in galaxy clusters have failed to resolve the issue of whether cooling flows are present. However, the FUSE detection of OVI emission in A2597 is consistent with a modest cooling flow and the detection in several individual elliptical galaxies demonstrates there the existence of cooling flows. The OVI doublet is a powerful diagnostic of gas that is cooling through the 10$^{{\rm 5.5}}$ K range, and here we propose to use it to determine if gas is cooling down from the ambient cluster temperature (T $\geq$10$^{{\rm 7}}$ K) as predicted by the cooling flow model. Our strategy is to observe two clusters that show large temperature drops and short radiative cooling times from Chandra X-ray data. These observations are crucial for showing whether cooling flows are suppressed or not.
D172|4| | |Neff|NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center|NGC5128 (Centaurus A) is the nearest active galaxy,  and serves as a prototype in many different arenas,  e.g., AGN + jet, low-powered radio galaxy (FR-type I), giant  elliptical galaxy, dominant cluster member, galactic cannibal,  and merger remnant.  FUSE provides an exciting new way to  explore the hot (1e5-1e6 K) gas in NGC 5128 by allowing  direct observation of the strong cooling lines OVI 1032,1038A.  We propose to probe the coronal gas in the galaxy where the relativistic jet collides with the more benign ISM and switches from super- to sub-sonic flow.  We expect to detect O VI in  emission from gas that is shock-heated by the impinging  relativistic jet.
D174|4| | |Espey|Trinity College Dublin|We propose observations of the eclipsing symbiotic system BF-CYG to study the lower levels of the red giant's wind and/or ejected material. This system has been well observed with IUE and has extensive, if sometimes contradictory, literature. IUE observations of BF-CYG show strong evidence for Rayleigh scattering by neutral hydrogen surrounding the M5 III primary, but also show an additional, currently unknown, scattering/opacity component. Our previous experience with FUSE data of the eclipsing symbiotic EG-AND (a system with an earlier spectral type, lower mass loss giant) shows that eclipse mapping is a powerful and sensitive way to determine the amount and nature of the atomic and molecular absorption, and also can lead to surprises (such as the presence of a broad, redshifted white dwarf wind component in the EG-AND case). Unlike massive binaries, the winds of a symbiotic system have very different characteristics -- the hot wind is relatively thin and fast, whereas the cool wind is slow and weakly ionized -- and hence they can be isolated spectroscopically.  The far-UV region of the spectrum is rich in a range of permitted and semi-permitted lines ranging from low to high excitation, and also containing the features of molecular hydrogen, thus permitting the diagnosis of material from the base of the giant's wind, them white dwarf wind, and the hot, shocked, material where the two interact. Phase-resolved spectra thus provide the unique tomographic information we require to model these systems and understand how the winds are generated and interact. We have FUSE Cycle 1 data for BF Cyg in an unabsorbed state, so have accurate fluxes and spectra for maximum light, against which we can compare the new observations. In addition, we have proposed to HST for STIS data to maximise the return possible from the combined far-UV/UV spectra.
D175|4| | |Iping|The Catholic University of America|The high-mass eclipsing X-ray binary system SMC X-1/Sk 160 will be observed for one complete binary orbit (3.892 days) to provide a detailed far ultraviolet  spectroscopic record of this important system. The spectra will be used to  1) characterize the phase-dependent X-ray ionization of the stellar wind and its density distribution, 2)study enhanced metal abundances in the photosphere of  the B0 Ib primary during X-ray eclipse, 3) study the effects of X-ray illumination on the stellar atmosphere facing the accretion disk, and  4) search for evidence of O VI emission from the accretion disk.  The O VI transition is a critical diagnostic of the ionized stellar wind. It is  sensitive to temperatures as high as E6 K, especially under  photoionization conditions like those in this X-ray binary system.  The numerous  strong wind  and photospheric lines in the FUSE range provide excellent  ionization and abundance diagnostics. The recent detection of O VII and O VIII  X-ray emission lines from the accretion disk indicates that O VI emission may  also be detectable by FUSE, and would provide a new tool to study the kinematics of the disk.
D180|4| | |Kruk|The Johns Hopkins University|The D/H and D/O abundance ratios have been found to be uniform within the local bubble, for lines of sight typically shorter than 100 parsecs. This is in contrast to results from IMAPS for 3 lines of sight spanning considerably greater distances.  Measurements of D/H and D/O in different environments is essential for an understanding of chemical evolution within the Galaxy.  Unfortunately, relatively few lines of sight have a velocity structure that is simple enough for reliable measurements to be made.  Preliminary measurements with FUSE for the two stars in this program reveal that these two lines of sight are promising for this purpose.  This proposal requests additional observing time to obtain signal-to-noise ratios adequate for measuring D/O.  A measurement of N(H) is available for one star (NGC 1360) from EUVE, permitting a D/H determination for that star as well.
D806|4| | |Leighly|The University of Oklahoma|We propose survey observations of low redshift soft X-ray selected AGN using FUSE.  These will be combined with 13 objects in the archive to investigate the role of the spectral energy distribution on the flux and profile of the OVI line.  Theoretical arguments on the nature of photoionized gas and resonance-line acceleration, combined with our previous FUSE observations of two objects indicate that there may be significant dependence.  However, we cannot exclude a dependence on luminosity, metallicity, or other factors at this point; a larger sample is required.  There are several advantages of using soft X-ray selected active galaxies for this investigation-- they have little X-ray absorption and are thus unlikely to be intrinsically reddened; a uniform X-ray selection allows an investigation of the breadth of the SED distribution; a range of spectral classes is represented.
D808|4| | |Sembach|Space Telescope Science Institute|We propose a FUSE snapshot program of 30 QSOs/AGNs selected to provide an excellent chance of having ultraviolet fluxes bright enough for detailed follow-up observations with FUSE and the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.  Our intent is to use these sources for absorption-line studies of the distribution and baryonic content of the low-redshift intergalactic medium.  We will begin this detailed spectroscopic follow-up with guaranteed COS time, and we will propose for extended FUSE observations of the brightest objects in the next proposal cycle.  In particular, we want to conduct a better O VI baryon census, study the physical conditions of individual absorption systems, determine the ionization mechanisms in the warm-hot intergalactic medium traced by O VI and other highly ionized species, and explore the structure/distribution of the ionized IGM.  Increasing the limited number of UV-bright sources currently available for such studies will allow for improved tests of the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution in the present-day universe.
D901|4| | |Clayton|Louisiana State University|The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are a small group of mainly cool (F-K type)  hydrogen-deficient carbon-rich supergiants which undergo very spectacular declines in brightness at apparently irregular intervals tied to the pulsation cycle of the star. Several emission lines are seen with unusually high excitation for such cool stars, including C II 1335, C III] 1909, C IV 1550, and He I 10830. It has long been suggested that when dust forms around an RCB star, radiation pressure accelerates the dust away from the star dragging the gas along with it. These lines may be collisionally excited in the flow. Recent near-UV and IR spectra have provided the first strong evidence that most if not all RCB stars have winds. We have obtained spectra of RCB stars that show P-Cygni profiles in the C II 1335 and He I 10830 lines.  The dust formation and mass-loss mechanisms in the RCB stars are not well understood. The existence of P-Cygni profiles gives us the opportunity to study mass-loss in these enigmatic stars. We expect to see other high excitation lines such as C II 1036, C III 977 and C III* 1176 from these carbon-rich stars. These observations will help us determine what the excitation and mass-loss mechanisms are. No spectra from the FUSE wavelength range have ever been  obtained for any RCB star.
D902|4| | |Points|Northwestern University|We have obtained high-resolution (15 km/s) spectra of interstellar NaI absorption toward 183 stars in the double open cluster h and Chi Persei. These spectra show remarkable variations in their line profiles over the spatial extent of the double cluster, especially when compared to HI 21-cm emission line profiles.  Because NaI is not a dominant ion in HI clouds, the variations detected in the NaI line profiles could be due to spatial differences in either the physical structure or the physical conditions of the interstellar gas.  The ultraviolet (UV) spectral region, where many diagnostic lines of important interstellar species such as H_2 can be observed, holds the key to understanding the structure seen in NaI.  We have recently obtained FUSE observations of six closely-spaced stars in the core of Chi Per that show remarkable small-scale variations of interstellar H_2.  These observations, however, do not allow us to investigate the larger scale interstellar structure of H_2 toward h and Chi Per. Therefore, we propose to conduct a FUSE survey of the interstellar structure of H_2 toward at least six of the 14 brightest early-type stars over a wide range of spatial distributions in h and Chi Per.
D903|4| | |Bonamente|University of Alabama in Huntsville|We propose to observe several quasars in the background of galaxy clusters, in search of redshifted  OVI resonant absorption lines from the intervening warm intergalactic medium. The presence of warm (T~10^6 K) gas in the neighborhood of galaxy clusters is predicted by cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and is observationally supported by the detection of `soft excess' emission in several galaxy clusters. In addition, the proposed observations will make a significant contribution to our understanding of T~10^6 K gas in the Galaxy, through the simultaneous observation of z=0 OVI lines.
D904|4| | |Blair|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose an unbiased ultraviolet survey of supernova remnants in the Magellanic Clouds.  Work in earlier cycles with FUSE indicates that optical and/or X-ray characteristics of supernova remnants are not always good predictors of the objects that will be bright and detectable in the UV. This survey proposal will test this conclusion by obtaining spectra of a random sample of Magellanic Cloud remnants with a broad range of radio, optical, and X-ray properties. Previously observed objects and remnants with known high extinction (or high column densities) are the only objects eliminated from consideration. A standard request of 10 ks per object using the LWRS aperture is used for the survey, reaching  a limiting flux in O VI 1032 of approximately 5x10^{-15}  ergs cm^-2  s^-1, or about a factor of 100 below the flux observed for the LMC  remnant N49.
D905|4| | |Froning|University of Colorado at Boulder|Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are interacting binary systems in which a white dwarf (WD) accretes mass from a late-type donor star. In non-magnetic CVs, accretion occurs via a disk around the WD.  CVs provide a nearby, non-obscured population of objects in which to probe the physics of disk accretion, which occurs in a wide range of astrophysical environments.  FUV observations of CVs target the structure and behavior of the inner accretion disk, the disk wind and the WD.  As a result, the FUV is an excellent window to explore unanswered questions concerning the vertical structure of the disk, the driving mechanism of the wind, and the physics of the disk/WD interaction region. We propose a FUSE survey of the FUV spectra of disk-accreting CVs as an expansion upon a Cycle 3 Observatory Program on CVs that has already achieved results of scientific interest.  We propose to obtain a broad sample of the time-averaged and time-variable properties of CVs in the FUV. We will use existing stellar, disk, and wind models to study broad trends in the properties of the WDs, accretion disks, and outflows in CVs as a function of viewing inclination, binary geometry, mass accretion rate, and evolutionary history.
D907|4| | |Dupuis|The Johns Hopkins University|In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to studying abundance patterns of metals in hot white dwarfs. These patterns are best understood in terms of radiative levitation. We propose to observe DA white dwarfs somewhat cooler than those previously studied, in the effective temperature range where support by radiative levitation is expected to become less important. We will search for photospheric absorption lines of C, N, Si, P, and S which may still be supported at effective temperatures below 22,000K. FUSE has revealed the presence of P in many of the hot white dwarfs observed so far and it is important to establish if this is true for cooler white dwarfs as well. Heavy elements such as Fe are not expected to be supported but may be present in the spectra if other physical processes such as accretion or mass loss perturb the delicate diffusive equilibrium. These observations will allow us to test diffusion theory in this interesting transition regime where radiative levitation support is expected to fade. When combined with existing data on hot white dwarfs available in the FUSE archive, we will have a comprehensive map of metal abundances versus effective temperature and gravity for the population of hot DA white dwarfs.
D909|4| | |Redfield|University of Colorado at Boulder|RS CVn systems are detached late-type binaries that are very active as a result of their tidally-enforced rapid rotation. They are actively studied and bright at X-ray and UV wavelengths, but very few have been observed by FUSE. Located in the FUSE spectral range are emission lines formed in plasma at 50,000 - 300,000 K (e.g., C III and O VI) and the coronal emission line Fe XVIII 974 A formed at 6,000,000 K, which permit us to measure the widths and velocity shifts to study stellar atmospheric dynamics and structure. We propose answer the following important questions, (1) Which star in selected active close binary systems is the dominant emitter in lines formed at different temperatures?  Studies of Capella show that the 10^5 K lines are predominately from the G1 III star, whereas the coronal line is mostly from the G8 III star. (2) Are the broad profiles seen in these rapidly rotating stars due to geometrically extended structures rigidly rotating with the star, or are they due to some other mechanism? Observations of our selected high declination systems observed at different orbital phases will allow us to answer these questions. (3) Search for outflows and downflows in lines formed at different temperatures.
D910|4| | |Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to use the FUSE satellite to determine the flare characteristics, winds, and accurate FUV irradiances for two solar-type stars that serve as proxies for the young Sun covering the first 300 Myr of its history.  This program is the remaining part of a comprehensive study of the  Sun in Time  across the electromagnetic spectrum. We have defined a sample of single G0-5 V stars with well-known rotation periods and ages that are proxies for the Sun at different times. One of the major goals of the program was the determination of the spectral irradiance of the early Sun which is now nearing completion. Our analysis and modeling indicate that the strong XUV emissions of the young Sun could have played a crucial role in the developing planetary system, in particular through the photoionization, photochemical evolution and possible erosion of the planetary atmospheres. An important, yet still missing, ingredient to understand the early Sun is the characterization of the solar wind, flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). FUSE is uniquely suited to address these important question, both thanks to its high spectral resolution and wavelength coverage. The FUSE wavelength region contains key spectral features such as the H Lyman series, C III, O VI and an important coronal Fe XVIII line. Thus, FUSE observations permit the simultaneous study of plasmas covering temperatures from ~10^4 K to ~10^7 K. Enhancements of the hotter lines, line profile asymmetries or superimposed absorptions are the manifestations of winds, CMEs and flares. This program is also crucial for understanding the operation of the solar dynamo and the transfer of magnetic energy within the chromosphere, the transition region and the corona of the Sun and solar type stars.
D911|4| | |Howk|University of California San Diego|We propose to identify UV-bright AGNs behind the outer halos of these two galaxies and use the brightest of these to probe the physics of the extended gaseous distribution of these systems.  We will obtain 7 ksec snapshots of 13 optically-bright AGNs within ~20 degrees of the centers of the Magellanic Clouds to identify targets bright enough for longer follow-up observations.
D912|4| | |Knauth|The Johns Hopkins University|Hot interstellar gas in the Galactic halo, as traced by the O VI ion, is patchy on degree-size length scales (Howk et al. 2002).  This variability carries  important, but poorly understood, information about the spatial distribution  and formation mechanisms of the O VI bearing gas.  Sites of massive  star formation in the disk are sources of hot gas in the interstellar medium  and many OB associations are known to have large H I shells surrounding them  (Cowie, Songalia, & York 1978; Heiles 1979).  The remnant shells of OB  associations and open clusters are prime candidates for the hot-cool interaction regions, which are thought to be the main sites of O VI formation in the  Galactic halo.  By observing multiple stars in a single young OB association, we can determine the length scales of O VI variability in the shells surrounding them and learn about their fragmentation and dispersal.  This will allow  constraints to be placed on their evolution and on the origin of the halo  O VI.  To accomplish this, we propose to obtain Far-Ultraviolet Spectroscopic  Explorer data on the interstellar O VI doublet at 1031 and 1038 Angstroms toward 10 stars in the Sco OB1 Association.
D913|4| | |Schlegel|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to survey a set of nova and nova-like cataclysmic variables underrepresented in the FUSE archive.  The novalikes are all high-mass transfer rate CVs and are believed uniformly to possess disk winds at all times.  The novae are all several decades old.  The proposed observations will provide the first far ultraviolet look at these CVs and will form the basis of several archival investigations, based upon experience with the IUE archive.  The spectra will certainly reveal inclination-dependent effects on the line emission following similar a study of CVs in the IUE archive.  The expected H$_2$ absorption may permit tighter bounds to be set on distance estimates.
E010|5| | |Bergeron|CNRS|The warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) has been recently detected by O,  sc vi  absorption features in the spectra of background QSOs at both low (z sim 0.1) and high (z sim 2.2) redshifts. Model simulations suggest that this IGM phase may contain a large fraction  of the baryons in the local universe up to sim 50 while still being a substantial component of the intergalactic medium at high z. The baryon fraction inferred from existing observations is still very uncertain, in large part because  the nature of the heatingionizing process of the WHIM is still under debate.  We propose to observe the O,:  sc v lambda630 EUV absorption associated with 11 intervening Ly-alpha systems (FUSE O,sc v redshift range .48-0.88) in PG 1718+481 (z_:em 1.084). The occurrence of O,sc v will be compared to that of O,sc vi from HST data. From the ionic ratios, we will constrain the ionization process as well as the oxygen abundance and determine whether a multi-phase  medium is required.  Species of different ionization level,  O,sc iv and Ne,sc viii or Mg,sc x, might also be detected in some of these absorbers.
E020|5| | |Evans|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|Quantitative understanding of the evolution of massive stars is vital in understanding galactic chemical enrichment, as well as the dynamic evolution of the interstellar medium.  Masses and radii have now been determined for a number of massive detached eclipsing binaries with an unprecedented accuracy of 2 These results can be used to test stellar evolutionary calculations. Unfortunately, for the hottest stars (O and early B stars) the tests are limited by the large uncertainty in the temperatures.  We propose to use FUSE spectra to improve the temperatures using both the energy distribution and line diagnostics.  This will provide temperatures of these important stars with an accuracy approaching 2 This will tighten the constraints on parameters such as core convective overshoot and also provide an excellent list of standard stars for comparison with FUSE spectra of, for instance, stars in the Magellanic Clouds.
E025|5| | |Raymond|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to study the interaction of a fast ejecta knot in SN 1006 with the ISM.  Unique XMM and Chandra observations will be combined with the O VI intensity and line profile to study the physics of the ISM shock, which we believe to be faster than 3000 kms.  We will obtain the kinetic temperature of oxygen for comparison with proton and electron temperatures.  Shocks in the heliosphere show oxygen temperatures above 16 times the proton temperature, while few measurements of supernova remnant shocks are available.  We will determine the size and density of the ejecta knot and explore its interaction with the ISM, and we may detect S VI emission from the ejecta.
E029|5| | |Henry|Johns Hopkins University|The diffuse far ultraviolet background has been difficult to observe and the only observations to cover a significant fraction of the sky have come from voyager UVS observations by Murthy et al.  While not optimized for the study of the diffuse background, FUSE is sufficiently sensitive to observe diffuse levels on the order of a few thousand photons. We propose to observe several locations in the Coalsack Nebula where we have already found intense diffuse emission and have placed limits of 0.3 -- 0.5 on the albedo. We cannot, however, determine whether or not the grains scatter isotropically or are strongly forward scattering. Through a suitable choice of locations, we will be able to break this degeneracy and determine, for the first time, the optical constants of the interstellar grains in this wavelength region.
E030|5| | |Martin|Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille|Herbig AeBe stars (HAeBes) are pre-main sequence stars of intermediate mass. They are the likely precursors of the beta-Pictoris and Vega-type stars, whose circumstellar debris disks are believed to host planetary bodies. At present, we do not know whether planets may form in every disk, or how long the planet formation process takes.  We propose to obtain FUSE spectra of a sample of HAeBes of known age whose spectral energy distributions present a low near-IR excess, which shows that most of the dust has been dissipated in the central part of the disk.  The analysis of H_2 lines in the FUSE spectra will allow us to quantify the gaseous content in the inner planet-forming regions of the disks around the stars and set limits on the timescale for planet building and dissipation of the circumstellar disks.
E031|5| | |Crenshaw|Georgia State University|We have discovered a decreasing radial velocity in an outflowing UV absorber in NGC 3783; this is the first detection of a changing radial velocity in a Seyfert absorber. The velocity decrease could be due to bulk deceleration of the gas or to a change in the direction of motion of the outflow across the line of sight to the broad-line region (BLR). The available evidence favors the latter possibility, which is exciting because it is predicted by dynamical models of accretion disk winds. A simple geometric model of a changing velocity vector predicts that the absorption lines will decrease in depth, and possibly even disappear, by early 2005. We propose two new  FUSE spectra of NGC3783, separated by 7 -- 12 months, to 1) follow the evolution of the absorbers radial velocity, 2) tightly constrain the tangential velocity of the absorber, and 3) provide a definitive test of the changing velocity-vector hypothesis, thereby constraining dynamical models of the outflowing gas.
E045|5| | |Hebrard|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|Deuterium abundance measurements allow constraints to be put on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the baryonic content of the Universe, and the chemical evolution of galaxies. Such measurements in a variety of astrophysical environments are one of the main objectives of FUSE.  According to the first  FUSE results, the DH ratio likely has a single value in the local interstellar medium (within sim100pc).  However, with increasing distance  and column density the DH values show significant dispersion and the three values measured at large distances are low; they may imply an averaged DH ratio significantly below the local value. These preliminary results suggest a present-epoch deuterium abundance below 1 x 10^-5, ie significantly lower than the value usually assumed. If these results are confirmed, they would challenge present models of deuterium evolution.  The small sample size of the distant targets available has not allowed definitive conclusions to be drawn. Moreover, the availability of hydrogen column density measurements is limited. Using oxygen and, to lower extent, nitrogen as hydrogen proxies, we propose to measure deuterium abundance toward four extra distant targets. Selected from previously completed FUSE snapshots observations, they are in the column density range of the three distant sight lines where low deuterium abundances were measured.
E054|5| | |Andre|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|It has long been recognized that the primordial abundance of Deuterium can be used as a baryometer and is directly linked to the Omega_b cosmological parameter.  Measurments of the primordial DH ratio have been performed in different astrophysical sites, in particular within Damped Lyman Alpha (DLAs) systems and Lyman Limit Systems (LLS) observed towards high redshifted quasars. The DLAs show generally a few percent solar metallicity and are the best candidates to investigate the primordial abundance of Deuterium. To date, the large measurement scatter prevent definitive conclusions to be drawn although a trend towards DH_primordial approx 2.5--3. 10^-5 has emerged.  DLAs and LLS are not the only low metallicity targets available for the investigation of the history of the Deuterium both the High Velocity Clouds (HVCs) and the Magellanic Clouds ISM are well known to have tenth solar metallicity.  HVCs targets have already been observed with  FUSE using distant QSOs as background sources.  However, SN ratios greater than approx 7 have never been achieved making the analysis quite uncertain.  In the SMC, despite higher SN, the situation is worst since the D small I lines are blended with the Galactic H small I lines to the point where the D small I absorption lines has never been reported.  However, the detection of the HD molecule in the diffuse SMC ISM with  FUSE makes it possible to have an indirect measurement of the DH ratio through HDHmol. In a recent mini--survey of the HD molecules in the Magellanic Clouds we have noticed an unexpectedly large HD column density towards AV95.  Higher SN  FUSE dara are mandatory to confirm our preliminary assesment and reduce the error bars on the HD column density (HDHmol  2 times DH).
E061|5| | |Knauth|Johns Hopkins University|Molecular nitrogen has never been observed in the interstellar medium.  Its abundance in translucent clouds is of considerable interest as the molecule is predicted to be the main sink of atomic nitrogen in these regions and an important precursor to dense cloud nitrogen chemistry.  Recent FUSE observations of atomic nitrogen (ionN1) have shown a deficiency at total column densities above N(H_tot)  1 times 10^:  21 cm^ -2 .  However, our preliminary search for the N_2 band at 958 AA has not yielded any reliable detection, even at levels well below those implied by the deficiency in NI.  Existing observations below 000 AA have achieved only marginal signal-to-noise (SN < 15), due to the steep rise of interstellar extinction.  Here we propose to obtain observations with high enough signal-to-noise (SN sim 50) to allow for a very sensitive search for N_2 toward a carefully selected sample of high column density targets.
E063|5| | |Tripp|University of Massachusetts|Recent observations of ionO6 and ionO7 absorption lines in the spectra of low-redshift QSOsAGNs offer tantalizing evidence that the missing baryons have been found, and that they are located in shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic gas at T  10^5 - 10^7K.  However, important uncertainties remain in the nature of the O  6 - and ion O  7 -bearing gases. Are these large, low-density, low-metallicity absorption systems that contain the large majority of the baryons, or are they smaller objects with higher densities and metallicities  We have been awarded 100 ksec of Chandra time to observe the bright X-ray binary LMC X-3 to study ionO7 and ionO8 absorption in the Milky Way halo with unprecedented sensitivity. This observation will provide crucial constraints on the size and distance of the absorbing gas since the target is in the Large Magellanic Cloud, i.e., these are both lesssim 50 kpc for any absorption detected in front of LMC X-3.  To investigate key questions about the ionO7ionO8 absorption, we must have high-resolution ionO6 observations in the same direction.  Here we propose to observe LMC X-3 with FUSE to obtain complementary constraints on ionO6 in the Galactic halo. With the combined FUSE+Chandra data, we will address the following questions -- (1) Are these absorbers located in the Galactic halo, or are they at greater distances in the Local Group  (2) Do the ionO6 and ionO7 absorption lines arise in the same (single-phase) gas, or are these lines more likely from different phases in a multiphase medium (3) Do the line properties indicate that the gas is collisionally ionized, photoionized, or both Could the absorption arise in non-equilibrium cooling gas The combined X-ray and UV data will also be invaluable for studying the accretion physics of this X-ray binaryblack hole candidate. Velocity variations of the ionO6 emission from LMC X-3 will place tight constraints on the accreting black hole mass.
E065|5| | |Jenkins|Princeton University|In conventional observations of hot stars, shallow, broad interstellar absorption features can escape detection because they are confused with stellar absorption features, even those that are rotationally broadened.  We propose to observe wide noninteracting) spectroscopic binary systems at different phases so that we can remove the stellar features by detecting their translations.  Our objective is to sense the presence of (1) gaseous material at Tsim 300,000,K with a velocity dispersion of order or more than 100, kms^-1 and (2) diffuse interstellar bands in the FUSE wavelength region.  To accomplish these goals, we plan to observe 3 binary systems at 7 different phases and then apply, in each case, a special analysis program that produces three separate spectra -- (1) the primary stars spectrum, (2) the secondary stars spectrum and (3) the stationary absorption features arising from the ISM.  The ISM features should be free of any perturbations arising from the stars.  
E068|5| | |Lobel|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to observe with the FUSE the far-UV spectrum of the peculiar variable yellow hypergiant rho Cassiopeiae, which offers an exceptional laboratory to investigate the poorly understood acceleration and wind driving mechanisms of evolved pulsating stars.  This cool enigmatic star became recently very active with a tremendous outburst event in the fall of 2000. During the event we directly observed the largest mass-loss rate (sim0.05  M_, yr^-1) in any stellar object so far (Lobel et al. 2003, ApJ, 583, 923).  Over the past two years since the eruption we observed a very prominent inverse P Cygni profile in Halpha, signaling a strong collapse of the upper atmosphere, also observed before the 2000 outburst.  Our continuous spectroscopic monitoring reveals that the Halpha line profile has transformed into a P Cygni profile over the past five months, presently signaling supersonic expansion velocities up to sim120 km,s^-1 in the upper atmosphere, similar as in the 2000 event. The fast atmospheric expansion is expected to continue over the coming year based on our recent monitoring.  We propose to observe the pumped Fesc ii emission lines at lambda1119 and lambda1124 to investigate their detailed line shapes using the high spectral resolution of FUSE. These line profiles will provide important clues about the wind acceleration mechanism in rho Cas during the exceptionally fast atmospheric expansion in Cycle 5. As the hypergiant changes spectral type from late F to G-K (or even early M), the Fesc ii emission lines are expected to reveal peculiar asymmetric shapes.  These profiles are observed in the smaller G-type supergiant alpha Aqr, but cannot provide direct evidence that its wind velocity structure is in fact accelerating outwards. FUSE observations of asymmetric FUV Fesc ii emission profiles in rho Cas will directly reveal if the wind velocity structure globally accelerates outwards in this cool star, or whether it is determined by the local gas dynamics that drives the fast expansion.  
E075|5| | |Cheng|California State University, Fullerton|Since the discovery of Vegas (A0V) large thermal infrared excess over the expected  photospheric flux, dust disks have been found around a large fraction of main-sequence A-type stars.  Visual and ultraviolet observations have revealed dynamic circumstellar gas disks around several Vega-type stars. Recent models of the dynamics of gas-dust coupling  in Vega-type circumstellar disks suggest that the structure of  dust disks strongly depends on the properties of  gas disks.  With high-resolution and high signal-to-noise visible and UV data, we have identified a least a dozen nearby A-type stars with circumstellar gas through a volume-limited survey. We have observed one of them (2And) with FUSE, and we propose to obtain FUSE spectra of four other early A-type stars with circumstellar gas identified by our survey.  The FUV spectral range contains many absorption lines that are good diagnostics of circumstellar gas.Our proposed FUSE observations will help answer the following questions related to the evolution of circumstellar disks. Are A-type stars with circumstellar gas and those with dust disks in the same evolutionary stage  Do dust disks develop only after most of the first generation gas has disappeared Is the observed circumstellar gas second generation, formed from destruction of falling bodies (comets or planetesimals) through collisions and evaporation
E076|5| | |Boisse|Ecole Normale Superieure/DEMIRM|HD34078 has a transverse velocity of 22 AUyr; the five FUSE spectra already obtained during cycle 1, 2, 3 allow us to probe the internal structure in the foreground translucent cloud by comparing lines of sight distant by simeq 10 to 0 AU at the cloud distance. The intercomparison of these high quality spectra SN simeq 20 at 1100 AA) led us to set an upper limit as low as 5 percent on N(H_2) variations. This result points towards very little ubiquitous density structure. In order to improve the sampling and increase the range of scales probed, we propose to extend our follow-up to five years by taking two spectra during cycle 5. A long-term increase in both N(CH) and N(HI) has been detected and FUSE cycle 5 observations could reveal similar variations for N(H_2). The FUSE data set accumulated on HD34078 is unique and, given the low cost in observing time involved, we think is important to increase its scientific potential by extending the follow-up as long as possible.
E079|5| | |Smith|Catholic University of America|The phenomenalogy of several variable subclasses of B stars arises from the interactions of magnetic fields, winds, diffusion, and rotational effects. We request FUSE observations at occultation and quadrature phases (2 for target 1, 3 for target 2) of a prototype of each of the magnetic He-strong and He-weak Bp classes. The C,IV and N,V resonance lines of these stars IUE spectra are at some phases strongly in absorption, and at other phases show redshifted emissions. These features form  in shocks where the wind impacts the magnetospheric torus-disks co-rotating over these stars. But what is the process responsible for the implied heating  UV spectroscopy can answer this by exploring the disk geometry inferred from the Fe-curtain and resonance lines from a large range of ions.  These diagnostics will be aided by turbulent broadening in resonance lines observed at disk-occultation. The behavior of both types of features will be contrasted with high-excitation photospheric lines, which show little change over the cycle. We will also explore the chemical fractionation of the metals in the disks by comparing UV analyses with ground-based observations of Balmer lines. 
E082|5| | |Massa|SGT, Inc. & NASA/GSFC|Psc v has emerged as an important wind diagnostic in fuse spectra of O stars.  Recent studies have demonstrated that mass loss rates determined from Psc v lines in LMC O stars are factors of 3 - 5 times lower than predicted by currently accepted models or mass loss rates determined from Halpha and radio measurements.  Furthermore, initial estimates for Galactic stars suggest a similar discrepancy.  This problem underscores the importance of deriving mass loss rates from independent observational material.  To examine the origin of the disagreement more closely, we propose to obtain Psc v data for a set of stars that have been modeled at Halpha and many of which have been observed in the radio.  These stars are the fundamental set which have been repeatedly compared to models and were a cornerstone in deriving the Wind Momentum-Luminosity relationship for O star winds.
E084|5| | |Collins|University of Colorado|We propose substantial  FUSE observations of the sight-line towards Mrk 290, which intercepts the high-velocity cloud (HVC) Complex C. These data will be used, along with new data for Mrk 290 and PG 1626+554 in the  FUSE archive, as well as data from planned observations of Mrk 501, to address Galactic interstellar gas mixing, infalloutflow, and chemical history.  The origin of Galactic HVCs seen in ionH1 emission and metal absorption lines has recently become better understood.  Our recent study (Collins, Shull, & Giroux 2003a) includes  FUSE and  HST data for eight sight-lines through Complex C, an HVC in the northern Galactic hemisphere. The large angular size of Complex C, as well as the existence of several extragalactic targets whose sight-lines pass through the cloud, allow us to investigate the interaction of an HVC with the Galactic halo as it plunges toward the disk, as well as the opportunity to probe the fossil record of earlier star formation.  With accurate metallicities based on O  1 ion H  1 , plus measurements of Si  2 , ion Fe  2 , ion S  2 , ion Ar  1 , and ion N  1 , our study suggests that Complex C is a mixture of infalling low-metallicity gas and enriched gas from the Galactic disk.  In addition, for the three sight-lines for which ionO1ionH1 could be measured, we found significant metallicity variations, ranging from ZZsubsun0.1-0.25.  The data quality for half of the sight-lines needs to be enhanced to permit sensitive abundance studies and to improve the statistics on any possible metallicity variations.  FUSE observations of Mrk 290 will provide the sensitivity necessary to measure the abundances of the important ions ionO1, ionAr1, ionSi2, and Fe  2 .  In addition, the measurement of (ArO) in a second Complex C sight-line could test for a top-heavy IMF in earlier generations of stars.
E087|5| | |Tumlinson|University of Chicago|We propose new observations of two AGN previously observed by FUSE, to explore the relationships between galaxy groups and the intergalactic medium (IGM). These observations will search for absorption lines of H I, C III, and OVI associated with 37 SDSS galaxy groups at known velocity along the sightlines. Such absorption could arise from the predicted hot phase of the IGM (the missing baryons) or from distant analogs of the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) seen near the Galaxy and Local Group.  Theory predicts that 30 - 40 percent of low-z baryons reside in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM; 10^5 - 10^7K), but only sim 10 percent have been found. Because galaxy groups are common, occupy a small fraction of space, and have been predicted to hold intragroup gas at temperatures just right for the WHIM, they are excellent places to look for the missing baryons.  We will also address the origins of OVI-bearing HVCs seen with FUSE, by complementing the FUSE survey of HVC OVI with multiple probes of galaxy groups along chordal sightlines.  Our approach maximizes scientific return by searching for absorption in groups identified in the SDSS.  Prior knowledge of galaxy group coincidences improves search efficiency because the number of such pairings varies widely between sightlines.  Our targets are chosen to maximize the number of groups that can be observed within a lesssim 200 ksec program.  Ultimately, our discovery program for OVI in galaxy groups will enable detailed probes of galaxyIGM associations, measure metallicity and excitation, improve statistics on the IGM OVI absorbers, and help generalize FUSE results on Local Group HVCs.  
E088|5| | |Andersson|Johns Hopkins University|Using a combination of FUSE and ROSAT data, we have shown that the Southern Coalsack is surrounded by a hot, OVI bearing, envelope.  Based on these observations we have identified the hot interior of the Upper Centaurus-Lupus UCL) super-bubble as the source of the heating of the cloud envelope.  This hypothesis is supported by a detection of OVI in the Lupus cloud, which is also embedded in the UCL bubble.  Here we propose to search for OVI absorption in four additional dense clouds located inside the UCL bubble.  The clouds span distances from the center of the bubble from 0.5 to 1.0 of the bubble radius and hence trace a time series of immersions of the clouds into the hot bubble interior.  Combined with observations of other highly ionization species, such a time series, in particular when analyzed together with the high spatial resolution data of the Coalsack, will allow quantitative tests of models of hot-cool interaction regions.
E090|5| | |Korpela|University of California, Berkeley|The Eridanus superbubble has been called the Rosetta Stone of superbubbles because virtually all of the processes which shape the interstellar medium are taking place somewhere within its boundaries.  One of the features of this region is the Eridanus Soft X-ray enhancement.  It is understood that this enhancement is a region of hot gtrsim 3times10^6 K) gas that fills the Eridanus cavity.  We propose to investigate two lines of sight for ionO6 lambdalambda 032,1038 emission, one which intersects an optically thick neutral cloud located within the X-ray emitting region and one which does not intersect the cloud.  The observation of the line of sight not intersecting the cloud, combined with a high signal-to-noise Cycle 2 archival absorption measurement of a QSO on a very nearby line of sight, will allow us to accurately determine the physical properties of 10^5.5 K gas within the superbubble.  The line of sight intersecting the cloud will provide additional information about the physical location of the emitting regions and the interface between the cloud and the hot gas in which it is embedded.  These data will allow us to distinguish between contrary theories of the structure of the ISM and energy transport mechanisms that occur within it.
E091|5| | |Stocke|University of Colorado at Boulder|In order to complete the suite of HST and FUSE observations necessary to detect and characterize the outflowing wind from our own Galaxys nuclear region, we request 25 ksecs on FUSE to observe 3 B-type comparison stars near one of our primary AGN sight lines. While there is indirect evidence for either a starburst or AGN-type wind from the Galactic Center (GC), this project seeks to detect this hot wind directly in absorption. Our two HSTFUSE AGN targets (PKS,2005-489 and Mrk,1383) lie within 10dd of directly over the GC, and so absorption lines of highly-ionized species like CIII, CIV, SiIV, NV, and OVI are expected. However, other potential sources of outflowing gas lie in the foreground of the GC (Sco-Cen OB Associations, 2-4 kpc away). In order to make sure that the absorptions we see in the AGN spectra are due to the GC, we require spectra of bright B stars, which are behind the Sco-Cen Associations but foreground to the GC.  HSTSTIS observations are scheduled for HST! cycle 12, and the necessary FUSE observations are all in-hand excepting spectra of 3 B stars near PKS,2005-489, which we are requesting here.
E095|5| | |Bregman|University of Michigan|The tremendous amount of star formation in starburst galaxies gives rise to supernovae, hot gas, and superwinds.  So it is no surprise that absorption by the OVI is seen in these systems, but we are stunned by the detection of even stronger OVI absorption in the bulge of M31, an extremely quiescent environment with little star formation.  Not only is this line strong, but is nearly black, which occurs only if the hot gas is pervasive in the bulge, and optically thick.  To determine if this is a common phenomenon, we propose to observe three other bulges of normal spirals, as hardly any have been observed with FUSE.  Also, we can determine whether this hot gas is flowing outward or inward by measuring the radial properties of the gas in M31.
E096|5| | |Bregman|University of Michigan|In the standard picture for grand design spirals, HI is converted to H_2 near spiral arms, triggering star formation.  This may not be occurring in the inner part of M51 as the amount of HI present is completely inadequate.  Either the molecular gas content, determined from CO, is badly wrong in the arm andor interarm regions, or the model paradigm must be discarded.  These issues will be resolved by an independent and accurate measurement of H_2 in the arm and interarm regions, which we can obtain with the proposed FUSE observations.  We have shown that H_2 absorption can be measured against the UV stellar light of the disk and we apply that technique for carefully chosen arminterarm pairs in M51.
E101|5| | |Wood|University of Colorado|MiraAB is one of the few wind accretion systems in which the components of the binary are resolvable.  It is therefore a unique laboratory for studying wind accretion processes, a common but not yet understood phenomenon in many astronomical sources.  Previous HST and FUSE spectra of MiraB, taken in 1999 and 2001 respectively, show a dramatic drop in UV emission from what IUE observed from 1979 to 1995.  Another baffling development is the appearance of a forest of Lyalpha-fluoresced H_2 emission lines, which dominate the HST and FUSE spectra despite not being seen at all by IUE.  One possible interpretation for the UV variability is that it is caused by periodic disk renewal, possibly associated with a 4-year periodicity previously seen in the optical.  Our proposed observation will test this interpretation, which predicts that MiraB should return to a high state during FUSE Cycle5, making a new FUSE spectrum radically different from the 2001 observation.  A new observation will also provide a UV spectrum contemporaneous with a planned Cycle5 Chandra observation of Mira, which is crucial for a proper interpretation of the X-ray data, and valuable for an accurate estimate of the total accretion luminosity of the system at that time.
E108|5| | |Iping|Catholic University of America|The high-mass X-ray binary Vela X-1HD,77581, consisting of a 283 s pulsarB0.5 Iab supergiant, will be observed at five critical phases of the binary orbit (8.96 days) to probe the effects of X-ray photoionization.  The pulsar ionizes its surroundings as it moves through the binary orbit, producing X-rays while accreting some of the ambient stellar wind from BO.5 Iab supergiant.  The FUSE spectra will be used to 1) characterize the phase-dependent X-ray ionization of the stellar wind and its density distribution, including the photoionization wake at phi0.6-0.9, 2) study enhanced abundances in the atmosphere of the primary,  and 3) search for the 283-s pulsar periodicity in the stellar wind lines.  o6 1032-38, s4 1063-73, and p5 1118-28 are the primary diagnostics to achieve these objectives.  These line profiles are unsaturated across the full velocity range of the stellar wind, resulting in a complete picture of the run of optical depth (or .:  M q)  with velocity. Strong saturation in the stellar wind lines at longer wavelengths (n5, c4, si4) have precluded such studies.  p5 is the only unsaturated transition of a dominant ionization stage in the wind, hence it provides a direct measure of the bulk wind properties.  Chandra HETGS spectra show the temperature of the X-ray ionized region of the wind is sim120,000 K, making o6 an excellent diagnostic of this plasma.  Our recent Cycle 4 observations of another HMXB system (4U1700-37) demonstrate the power of the FUSE region for studying the effects of the X-ray source on the stellar wind that feeds the accretion.  
E109|5| | |Iping|Catholic University of America|We propose a Target of Opportunity program to study the halo and ISM of a low-redshift galaxy hosting a bright new supernova (Vle 14).  The primary objectives are to characterize the ionization state, gas-phase abundances, metallicity, and gas kinematics in the ISM and halo of the host galaxy, and, if the properties of the sightline are favorable, in the intervening intergalactic medium.  Core-collapse supernovae occuring in galaxies out to the Virgo cluster are the potential targets for this program.  The FUSE spectral range provides a comprehensive set of lines to study the hot, warm, and cool phases of the ISM.  The FUSE spectra will be augmented by HSTSTIS TOO observations E140M, 1160<lambda<1700AA) of the same object for which we already have allocated time.  New core-collapse supernovae (SN types II, Ib, Ic), with their strong, nearly featureless UV continua, provide outstanding opportunities to obtain high-quality absorption line spectra of the gas on the line of sight to the SN, but only if the observations are executed within sim1 week of outburst.  Our team has the experience and extensive ground-based support to promptly assess the suitability of each newly-discovered supernova for this program and to quickly provide all the necessary data to rapidly execute the observations.
E112|5| | |Good|University of Leicester|We propose a FUSE observation of the hot DAO white dwarf in the 3.1,hr eclipsing binary NN,Ser, to accurately measure its effective temperature for the first time. Previously obtained high sn, high time resolution photometry from the ULTRACAM instrument has detected both the primary and secondary eclipses,  allowing the system geometry to be accurately constrained. When combined with planned radial velocity measurements at the ESO VLT, it will be possible to derive a model-independent mass and radius for the white dwarf, allowing NN,Ser to be used to test the white dwarf mass-radius relation. However, at temperatures above 30,000K this relation is temperature sensitive (and as a DAO NN,Ser is at least 45,000K). Thus, an accurate temperature is now required. 
E113|5| | |St-Louis|Universite de Montreal|We propose to observe the intriguing Wolf-Rayet star WR46 to identify the origin of the eight-hour periodicity observed in its optical photometry and in the radial-velocity variations of the lines with the highest ionizationexcitation potential. FUSE is an ideal tool to do so because of the presense of the Osc vilambda1032, 1038 AA resonance doublet which provides a sensitive probe to potentially energetic phenomena taking place in the wind of this star. This, combined with the possibility to follow our target over more than one contiguous cycle makes FUSE a unique tool to address this question. Other transitions of lower ionizationexcitation potentials such as Csc iiilambda977 AA are also present in the spectrum of this star and will help provide further constraints on the physical processes taking place.  Depending on the outcome of the program, we will either (a) confirm the binary status of WR46 making it the 2^nd WR+compact companion binary system known or (b) discover the first pulsating WR star or (c) provide one of the first rotational period measurements for a WR star.
E114|5| | |Long|Space Telescope Science Institute|The FUV spectra of quiescent dwarf novae are complex. Earlier FUSE and HST observations suggest there are contributions from the entire surface of the white dwarf, from a rapidly rotating accretion belt, from the boundary layer, and from the accretion disk. It has, however, been extremely difficult to distinguish them from one another. As a result, our understanding of the physics of DN systems in transition to quiescence is poor.  Although the FUV spectra of DN are known to vary during optical quiescence in response to outbursts, neither FUSE nor HST have ever been used to conduct an intensive systematic study of the evolution of the FUV spectrum. We therefore propose to rectify this situation by using FUSE to observe VW Hyi over an entire interoutburst cycle to isolate the various components and to determine how they evolve during the quiescence period between outbursts. The dwarf nova VW Hyi and FUSE are uniquely suited for this study because the white dwarf dominates FUSE spectra at longer wavelengths, but other components dominate near the Lyman limit.
E118|5| | |Kruk|Johns Hopkins University|The DH and DO abundance ratios have been found to be uniform within the local bubble, for lines of sight typically shorter than 100 parsecs.  At greater distances, IMAPS measurements of DH for 3 lines of sight show considerable scatter, and FUSE measurements of DO for 8 lines of sight exhibit a trend of decreasing values with increasing distance.  Measurements of DH and DO in different environments is essential for an understanding of chemical evolution within the Galaxy.  Unfortunately, relatively few lines of sight have a velocity structure that is simple enough for reliable measurements to be made.  Preliminary measurements with FUSE for three of the four stars in this program reveal that these lines of sight are promising for this purpose.  The one star without prior FUSE data is quite bright and wont require much observing time, and within the limits of IUE high-dispersion spectra it too appears to have a simple line of sight.  This proposal requests additional observing time to obtain signal-to-noise ratios adequate for measuring N(DI) and N(OI).  N(HI) will be determined from archival IUE, GHRS, STIS, or EUVE data, permitting a determination of DH as well.
E119|5| | |Leighly|University of Oklahoma|We propose 5 monitoring observations of the extreme Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy, 1H0707-495. HST and previous FUSE observations show that the high-ionization lines in this object are dramatically blueshifted, and are thus inferred to be strongly dominated by emission in a wind.  Photoionization modeling of the high-ionization lines reveal two solutions a high density solution located close to the central engine, and a low density solution located much further away.  Interestingly, these two solutions correspond to two families of dynamical wind models.  We propose to differentiate between these solutions and wind models by comparing O  6  emission line and continuum variability on two time scales of days and months that conveniently correspond well with the light-travel time to the candidate emission regions.  Of the three NLS1s with extremely blueshifted lines known, 1H0707-495 is the best target because it is bright, its low redshift means that the O  6  complex is observed in the Lif1a spectrum, and its high declination means it is relatively easily accessible by FUSE.
E120|5| | |McCandliss|Johns Hopkins University|Recent observations of two planetary nebulae, NGC 6720 and NGC 7293 (the Ring and Helix Nebulae), find the peak in the near-infrared quadrupole vibrational transitions of H_2  to be coincident with the bright optical structure. Vibrational states of molecular hydrogen can be populated radiatively, following absorption and subsequent re-emission of far-UV photons or by thermal processes, such as shocks. Historically, there has been disagreement about the excitation mechanism of the molecular gas in planetary nebulae, and we propose to resolve these issues through FUSE observations. The electronic transitions responsible for the far-UV cascade of H_2 cannot be excited thermally, thus the detection of the fluorescent signature with FUSE would allow us to unambiguously determine the degree to which radiative excitation is responsible for the observed infrared emission.  These observations would serve two purposes, clarifying the physical processes at work in NGC 6720 and 7293 while continuing our investigation of the far-UV characteristics of molecular hydrogen and dust in a range of environments.  Planetary nebulae complement our existing program to observe reflection nebulae by exploring a new range of gas densities where a much harder ultraviolet radiation field is present.  This diverse set of environments allows us to constrain models of the formation and destruction of molecular hydrogen in photodissociation regions.
E121|5| | |Nichols|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|R Aqr is a symbiotic binary system with two counterposed jets.  At a distance of 200 pc, this object is the closest astrophysical jet system, and thus represents one of our best opportunities to understand the spatial structure and the origin of the jets.  The jets presumably originate in an accreting disk around the compact object in the binary system, but the mechanism of jet ejection is unknown.  Models of the R Aqr jets indicate shocks are necessary to explain the origin of the jets, but are not sufficient.  Parcels of denser gas are being accelerated within the jets and must play a role.  Modeling has been complicated by the variability of the N V and C IV emission lines in IUE data.  In addition, Chandra X-ray data clearly show the presence of 10^6 gas within the jets.  Extensive optical and IUE-regime UV spectrophotometry provide information on the 10^3 and 10^4 gas.  In order to constrain the models it is essential to have information on the 10^5 gas as revealed with O VI FUSE observations.  O VI data can limit the shock velocity.  With FUSE observations of the jets, placed in the aperture for maximum spatial information, we can localize any O VI emission within the jets and correlate the O VI with emission at other wavelengths with arcsec resolution.  We will then model the shock or shocks, including the contribution of the accelerated denser clumps of gas.  The jets in R Aqr bear many similarities to other astrophysical stellar jets, so investigation of this nearby system can provide tremendous gain in understanding of astrophysical jets in spite of observational difficulty.
E122|5| | |Wesemael|Universite de Montreal|We propose FUSE observations of a sample of 13 cool subdwarf B stars known to exhibit very low amplitude (lta 5 millimag), long-period 1000-5000 s), multiperiodic luminosity variations (the PG 1716 stars).  These variations are interpreted as high radial order g modes.  Current numbers indicate that the cool PG 1716 pulsators are much more common than their hotter counterparts, the shorter period EC 4026 stars discovered several years ago in the region below 28,000 K where the long-period pulsators are found, it may well be that all sdB stars are variable, a results that contrasts with the observed lack of purity of the instability strip of the EC 14026 stars. Despite these important differences, it has been suggested that the driving mechanism operating in the long-period variables is the same as that thought to operate in the EC 14026 stars driving is linked to the opacity bump associated with a local enhancement of the iron abundance in the envelope brought about by radiative forces on that element.  Abundance analyses of PG 1716 stars based on FUSE observations will permit a test of these ideas. Specifically, we will investigate whether the atmospheric abundance of iron peak elements is  i) consistent with that required to drive the pulsations in the PG 1716 stars and ii)  sufficiently homogeneous among the PG 1716 stars to account for the statistics of variable vs. non variable stars among cool sdB stars.
E124|5| | |Shelton|University of Georgia|The halo is rich in highly ionized gas.  But, what is the history of this gas  Was it ejected from the disk into the halo, or heated in the halo by energetic events  The emission from oxysix may provide the key to this puzzle.  In this proposal, we present a shadowing strategy for determining the height of the bulk of the oxysix emission, and thus whether the halo oxysix ions seen in column density observations are hot (and so emissive) or not.  In addition, these observations will examine the relationship between intermediate velocity clouds and oxysix emission, a relationship that was hinted at by two of the eight existing oxysix emission observations and these observations will examine the complex relationship between oxysix emission (tracing sim3 times 10^5K gas) and soft X-ray emission (tracing sim 10^6K gas).
E130|5| | |McCall|York University|Nearly all galaxies within roughly 4 Mpc of the Milky Way are confined to a sheet-like structure less than 1 Mpc thick, known as the Local Sheet.  Our unique perspective from within the Local Sheet makes it possible to investigate whether the missing baryonic matter of the universe is in the form of warm gas (10^5 K) permeating the filaments and sheets comprising the cosmic web.  Widespread warm gas would be evidenced unambiguously by a decline in the equivalent width andor frequency of OVI absorption in background AGNs with increasing altitude above or below the Sheets mid-plane.  Owing to a lack of suitable data at low altitudes, we propose to observe bright AGNs in two altitude intervals,  (1) within 7^circ of the mid-plane, where the optical depth of OVI ought to be maximized, and (2) between 17^circ and 23^circ, where the optical depth should be 2.5 times lower.  These data will be combined with data for AGNs at higher altitudes to search for an altitude dependent OVI signature indicative of widespread local gas with a planar geometry.
E139|5| | |Weaver|JHU-APL|As demonstrated during our recent  observations of three long-period comets, fuse provides an extremely sensitive probe of argon and CO in cometary nuclei. The argon abundance is a sensitive tracer of the thermal history of cometary nuclei, and it also provides a critical test of the hypothesis that cometary bombardment provided most of the volatile inventory in the terrestrial planet atmospheres. The only remote means of detecting argon in comets is through observations of its fluorescence emissions at FUV wavelengths lambdalambda1048,1066), and fuse provides far greater sensitivity in this region than any other available facility. The CO abundance is highly variable among comets, and this is presumably related to the formation conditions of cometary nuclei and their subsequent thermal processing. fuse can measure CO emission in comets with exceptional sensitivity, reaching down to abundance  levels of sim0.1 on the elemental abundances of H, C, O, and N, and on the production of htwo and ion:  O  6 , the latter being produced by the same charge exchange mechanism that produces cometary x-ray emissions. Finally, nearly half of the more than 90 FUV cometary emissions detected during our previous fuse observations remain unidentified and are deserving of follow-up study in other comets. Comet C2001Q4 (NEAT) is expected to reach naked-eye brightness during late-April of 2004, at which time will be an excellent target for fuse. Cycle5 may be the last opportunity during the remaining lifetime of fuse to make such a sensitive search for argon and other FUV emissions in a comet because apparitions of bright comets that meet fuses observing constraints only occur every 2-3 years.
E145|5| | |Ake|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to obtain FUSE observations of the 249^d-period, zeta Aur-like binary, 22Vulpeculae. The atmospheric eclipsing nature of this G3Ib+B9V system allows a spatial mapping of the temperature, density, and wind velocity in the outer atmosphere of a G-type supergiant located in the region of the HR diagram amongst luminous stars with cool, massive winds.  In Cycle 3, we were allocated time to observe the May 2002 eclipse, but due to the loss of the FUSE reaction wheels, we were able to obtain only two pre-ingress observations of this system. These FUV spectra show evidence of a cool, high velocity wind of sim-100 kms^-1, indicating the primary of 22Vul is undergoing substantial outflow typical of other G-type supergiants. Surprisingly the spectra also show evidence for absorption in OVI, which suggests the presence of a hot wind or circumstellar envelope. Thus 22Vul may fall into the class of hybrid stars. In Cycle 5, 22 Vul has daily observability windows for pm3 weeks around the June 2004 eclipse, a situation unique for the foreseeable future. FUSE observations during partial and total eclipse phases will be used to study the kinematics and structure of the transition region, corona, wind, and circumstellar material of the G-type supergiant and relate these to FUSE observations of other luminous, cool stars.
E146|5| | |Espey|Trinity College Dublin|Eclipsing symbiotic binaries are ideal objects to study the mechanism of stellar wind formation.  Due to the differing nature of the two components in symbiotics (one a hot white dwarf of subdwarf, the other a cool giant) the two winds can be isolated spectroscopically.  Through choice of system if is also possible to find different combinations of hot and cool star masses, luminosities, and mass loss.  Such a range of properties provides the vital underpinning of studies to understand the mechanism of wind formation and to test the theory of line-driven winds.  For eclipsing symbiotics we can make use of the finite size of the white dwarf to provide a pencil beam through successive layers of the outer atmosphere of the giant.  We have successfully used FUSE to study two such systems and find FUSE ideally suited to this work - the varying column density in  low ionization absorption lines as a function of phase can be determined by line fitting and, in addition, radial velocities determined. The proposed observations extend the previous work to other spectral types and mass loss rates and enable validation of both theoretical wind models and whole-disk giant atmosphere models.
E152|5| | |Chayer|Johns Hopkins University|We propose FUSE observations of a sample of hot subdwarf B stars (sdB) in order to carry out an abundance analysis of heavy elements and see how their abundance patterns emerge from the observations.  It is a well known fact that the atmospheres of these extreme horizontal branch stars exhibit abundance anomalies.  Diffusion processes such as gravitational settling, radiative levitation, weak stellar winds, and accretion have been proposed to explain the abundance anomalies.  Our goal is to identify which mechanisms operate in the atmospheres of these stars, study their interactions, understand the abundance patterns, and ultimately, constrain the structure of the atmospheres of sdB stars.  However, only a handful of stars have been analyzed so far.  To remedy to this situation we are currently analyzing high resolution optical spectra of a large number of sdB stars that we obtained with the Multiple Mirror Telescope.  To complete this extensive abundance analysis we need FUSE observations, because many resonance lines of elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and many iron peak elements are only visible in the FUV range for the effective temperatures of interest.  This study will not only provide new insights to the stellar atmosphere structure of sdB stars, but also to the evolution of galaxies since these stars are the most important candidates for the source of the UV excess in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges.  Combining FUSE and high resolution optical observations is essential for carrying this investigation through to a successful conclusion.
E153|5| | |Kruk|Johns Hopkins University|This program attempts to determine empirical values for OI transition oscillator strengths (f-values) throughout the FUSE wavelength range.  OI f-values are of particular importance due to the use of oxygen as a proxy for hydrogen in many studies of interstellar medium abundances.  A few of the available oscillator strengths have values determined from laboratory measurements, but these transitions are saturated for all but the lowest-column density lines of sight.  The other transitions have theoretical f-values only; most of these appear to give reasonably consistent results but some are clearly in error by orders of magnitude.  By obtaining high signal-to-noise spectra of carefully-selected, well-understood lines of sight, we will  determine the f-values for nearly all the OI transitions in the FUSE bandpass relative to the few strong transitions with laboratory-measured values.  
E159|5| | |Iping|Catholic University of America|We propose phase-resolved FUSE observations of three massive colliding wind binaries in the Galaxy HD149404 HD93205, and HD93403  to determine the dot M v_ ratio in each system and the collision geometries.  The systems have different masses, eccentricities, and  evolutionary states.  The massive O-type binary HD93205 is a double-line spectroscopic system consisting of an O3.5,V and an O8,V star in a 6.08-day orbit.  HD93403 consists of an O5.5I and an O7V star in a 15.093 day orbit.  Both are located in the Carina OB1 Association.  In HD93403, the winds are comparable in strength, while for HD93205 the wind of the O3.5 star will dominate.  HD149404 consists of type O7.5 I(f) and an ON9.7 I star.  The latter is a highly evolved O star.  Phase-locked wind variability and wind-wind collision effects in the three binaries will be studied as traced by changes in terminal velocity and optical depth of the large number of wind diagnostics in the FUSE spectral range (O VI, S VI, C III, N III, S III, IV, & VI, P V, Si IV) S IV, S VI, Si IV and P V lines are important and unique probes of O star winds because  they are strong but not saturated.  P V is expected to be the dominant ionization stage of P in HD93205, the more massive one of the two with a much higher v_, while Si IV is expected to be the dominant stage of ionization HD93403 and HD 149404. We propose four phase constrained observations of each system at the quadrature points in order to map the wind interaction zone.
E161|5| | |Guinan|Villanova University|Over the last several years we have been carrying out a study of stellar magnetic activity, dynamos, atmospheric physics, and spectral irradiances from a sample of G0--5 V stars with different ages (see Guinan et al.  2003a).  One of the major goals of this program is to study the evolution of the Suns XUV spectral irradiance with time. Of particular interest is the determination of the young Suns high levels of XUV fluxes because of the critical roles that X-ray and FUV coronal and chromospheric emissions play on the photochemical and photoionization evolution (and possible erosion) of early young planetary atmospheres and ionospheres. Motivated by the upcoming exoplanetary search missions (such as Kepler, Eddington, SIM and DarwinTPF) that will search for earth-size planets in the habitable zones of nearby G--K stars, we are proposing to extend this program to cooler, less luminous, (but much more numerous) early K-type stars. This program parallels our Sun in Time program, but extends the study to stars with deeper convective zone depths. We wish explore the effect of the convective zone depth on magnetic activity by comparing dwarf G and K stars with similar rotation periods (and ages).  We plan to combine the FUSE FUV observations with X-ray, EUV, and UV (from IUE or HST) to form spectral irradiance tables. Our sample of targets covers ages from sim100 Myr (P_:rot 1.8 d) to 7--8 Gyr (P_  rot 45 d). With FUSE nearing the end of its usable lifetime, this may be the last chance to secure this important FUV dataset, which is critical to stellar dynamo models. The observations would also have a major impact on studies of FUV radiation and its effects on the environments of exosolar planets and possible origin and evolution of extraterrestrial life.
E163|5| | |Kirshner|Harvard College Observatory|We propose observing a newly-discovered supernova with FUSE as a target of opportunity.  Our experience with HST and IUE ultraviolet spectra shows how informative they can be.  With FUSE, we can explore a previously unobserved part of the spectrum where many important lines will help in building a complete picture, especially of circumstellar interactions.  The resolution of FUSE is excellent for this purpose because it neatly separates circumstellar features from interstellar lines and the ability to move promptly to a good target is a very large advantage over HST.  A recent example of a typeII, SN 1998S, illustrates what a STIS spectrum can (and cannot) do, and gives us a solid basis for predicting what is required for measurements with FUSE.  We hope to continue our HST Target-of-Opportunity program, and we would aim to combine our FUSE observations both with our ground-based data and with STIS data.  
E169|5| | |Ballester|University of Arizona|We propose to observe two extrasolar systems in which a giant planet EGP) orbits at only apprx10 stellar radii from the parent star in order to detect the effects of magnetic andor tidal interactions in these systems.  Recent reports of the chromospheric CaII H & K optical line emissions of HD 179949 have shown a convincing dependence on planetary phase, with peak emission at phiapprx0 when viewing the stellar sub-planetary hemisphere (but not at phiapprx0.5).  This is indicative of a magnetic interaction between the star and its close-in EGP.  A FUSE detection of the planet-star interaction is promising, since it is well known that stellar chromospheric, transition region or coronal perturbations will produce stronger signatures in the UV than in the CaII optical lines.  In addition, HD 79949 is an X-ray bright star and its chromosphere is particularly active.  Our main scientific objective is therefore to measure FUV variations in the stellar flux of HD 179949 sampling different planet orbital phases (eg, phiapprx 0--0.5) to detect the stellar effect at the relevant geometries of the interaction.  As a bonus, the probability of a FUSE detection of auroral type FUV emissions from an EGP resulting from the strong stellar interaction will also be the highest for this system among all known close-in EGPs.  A secondary objective is to extend our studies of the HD 209458 system, the only one with the close-in EGP observable in transit, which has allowed for the HST detection of an extended hydrogen upper atmosphereexosphere in HLya absorption, with a substantial escaping component.  With FUSE spectra resolving the FUV emissions of the star we will be able to characterize the stellar EUV output, a necessary and critical input to models for the upper atmospheres of EGPs that are required to interpret observations of the extended atmosphere and to estimate atmospheric escape rates.
E510|5| | |Grady|Eureka Scientific|Spatially-resolved spectroscopy  at Lyman alpha and narrow-band imaging has demonstrated that Herbig Ae stars drive collimated, bipolar outflows through much of their pre-main sequence evolution, and therefore closely resemble young solar-mass T Tauri stars. For those objects, the stellar magnetic field is important in channelling material accreting onto the star and in collimating the outflow.  FUSE is uniquely suited to determine whether an A star is still accreting, whether it exhibits signatures of stellar activity, and  whether it is driving a coronaldisk wind, since the FUV excess and emission line signatures at FUSE wavelengths have high contrast compared to the stellar photosphere. Recent FUSE observations of beta Pic and HD 100453 indicate that stellar activity persists into  the early phases of an A stars main sequence lifetime and is accompanied by the development of a coronal or disk wind as the star approaches the ZAMS. At present we do not know what the relation between the development of the coronaldisk wind and the jet outflow is, how this relates to the degree of central clearing of the disk, and whether there is any correlation with accretion rate. These are the questions we will address by supplementing the current FUSE archival holdings of actively accreting Herbig Ae stars and the brightest debris disk systems with observations of older Herbig Ae stars, and a suite of comparison A stars which are members of nearby stellar associations with secure age measurements. 
E511|5| | |Blair|Johns Hopkins University|With their known distances, wealth of accessible targets for observation at many wavelengths, and lower metallicities than the Milky Way, the Magellanic Clouds are unique laboratories for astronomers.  We propose FUSE Legacy observations of stars in the Magellanic Clouds to build on and improve earlier work in significant ways.  Target selection is driven by several considerations that broaden the existing Magellanic Clouds data sets for use in both stellar and interstellar work and leverage previous efforts.  Criteria include stellar parameter space coverage (spectral type and luminosity class), spatial sight line coverage across each Magellanic Cloud, new sight lines close to previously observed stars to provide more detailed sampling of coherent sub-structures such as bubbles or shells, ISM sight line properties e.g. E(B-V) values), and previous or planned HST (GHRS or STIS) coverage at longer wavelengths.  The data requested here will expand the existing collection of FUSE observations in the Magellanic Clouds into a true Legacy of the project for use by future astronomers as well as our team.
E526|5| | |Savage|University of Wisconsin-Madison|We propose to obtain a total of 708 ksec of integrations on 11 bright QSOs in order to study the physical conditions and baryonic content of the highly ionized IGM over a total redshift path Deltaz  3.8 with a 3sigma detection limit of <50mAA. This will extend the total redshift path for such observations from 4.9 to 8.7. The FUSE observations, when combined with HST spectra from 1150 to 1800AA, will permit the study of sim53 (+34, -23) OVI IGM systems with rest equivalent widths >50mAA. The redshifts of the QSOs will allow us to probe multiple ion states of oxygen (OVI, OIV, and OIII), CIII, SiIII, and possibly NeVIII. Having access to a range of ion states is crucial for determining the origin(s) of the ionization and the baryonic content of the highly ionized IGM. This is an important problem in observational cosmology since the first estimates with FUSE and HST imply that the highly ionized IGM is a major reservoir of the missing baryons in the universe at low redshift. The observations will nearly double the number of QSOs for which medium quality (SN >10) FUSE spectra will exist. The measurements will also be valuable for numerous Legacy studies by the general astronomical community including -- the physical conditions in the Milky Way halo and disk H_2), OVI and other ions in HVCs, the properties of the low redshift HI forest, photoionized QSO metal line systems, and the properties of QSOs and their associated absorption line systems. We recommend that the 6 brightest QSOs be observed in Cycle5 and the 5 faintest in Cycle6 of this two year program.
E542|5| | |Ayres|University of Colorado|A week-long FUSE stare at short-period eclipsing RS CVn binary AR Lac K0IV+G4IV; P2d), coordinated with groundbased radio imaging and optical Doppler mapping, will provide an unprecedented view of structure, energetics, and dynamics of hot-gas activity, through time-resolved measurements of FUV diagnostics like C III 977, O VI 1031, and (coronal forbidden line) Fe XVIII 974.  As a class, RS CVns are notorious for extreme high-energy emissions even during quiescent periods, but are most spectacular during flare outbursts. Our project is the cool star equivalent of a Hubble Deep Field, in the time domain; a new window on magnetic activity in extreme environments ubiquitous in the Cosmos, but only now beginning to be characterized and understood.  (Although the FUSE program is stand-alone, we plan to broaden and enhance the campaign by requesting Chandra HETGS and HST STIS time to be coordinated with the FUV spectroscopy.)
E568|5| | |Holberg|University of Arizona|Although  FUSE has devoted a considerable fraction of its observing program to the study of white dwarf stars, significant unfilled gaps remain in the scope and depth of these observations.  The majority of  FUSE white dwarf observations have been motivated by a variety of objectives, including instrumental calibration, studies of the ISM, as well as programs focused on particular details of the photospheres of these white dwarfs.  We propose a Legacy program of white dwarf observations designed to fill these gaps.  This program is tightly focused on H-rich DA white dwarfs, which constitute the overwhelming majority of all white dwarfs, and is specifically designed to address the resolution of the recently discovered discrepancy between Lyman line and Balmer line temperature and gravity determinations.  The observations resulting from this program will ensure that the final  FUSE archive contains the widest possible sampling of the population of DA white dwarfs.
E805|5| | |Bianchi|Johns Hopkins University|We analysed archival FUSE and HSTIUE  spectra of O-type stars in the Milky Way and found T_eff and luminosities significantly lower (approx 10 to 20 than previous determinations for our sample stars, and than values assigned to their spectral types from previous compilations. This result has great implications for our understanding of massive stars evolution, and of the energy balance of HII regions.  An effort  to analyse homogeneously a representative number of stars covering the early spectral types, would ultimately provide a refined calibration of the temperature scaleversus spectral type and luminosity class, as well as other important parameters such as mass loss rates.  However, crucial gaps remain in the coverage of the early spectral types in the list of FUSE observed or approved Galactic stars.  We propose  to observe a small number of stars to remedy the most conspicuous gaps.  By contrast, a very good coverage of spectral types  for Magellanic Cloud stars is already available in the FUSE archive. A similar sampling of the early spectral types  in the Milky Way will provide a unique opportunity to compare massive stars parameters  among the three galaxies with very different metallicities (MW, LMC, SMC). Additionally, the data will be of great value for population synthesis work.
E821|5| | |Brown|Space Telescope Science Institute|In FUSE Cycle 3, we obtained the first far-UV observations of He-sdB stars, which complemented the ongoing FUSE observations of normal sdB stars.  Based on our theoretical models, we demonstrated that some He-sdB stars likely form from a delayed He-core flash on the white dwarf cooling curve (Lanz et al. 2003).  The convection zone produced by such a flash penetrates the hydrogen envelope, mixing hydrogen into the hot He-burning interior, and triple-alpha carbon outward into the envelope.  The resulting flash-mixed star shows greatly enhanced helium and carbon at its surface.  This phenomenon is analogous to the born again scenario for producing H-deficient R CrB stars following a very late He-shell flash.  The spectra of two of the three He-sdB stars in our previous FUSE program show a striking enhancement of carbon, just as expected for flash mixing.  In view of this success, we propose to follow our He-sdB work with observations of three high-gravity (logg> 6) He-rich sdO stars.  The location of these stars in the logg - log T_  eff  diagram is not populated by canonical evolutionary tracks for stars leaving the horizontal branch or asymptotic giant branch (AGB).  We hypothesize that the high-gravity stars may be the progeny of the flash-mixed He-sdB stars.  Although FUSE is observing many He-rich and He-poor sdO stars, most of these are post-AGB stars; in contrast, the high-gravity region of parameter space is largely unexplored in the UV.  Our proposed observations would therefore extend the library of subdwarf spectra and further explore this newly discovered evolutionary channel for producing hot stars.
E848|5| | |Sembach|Space Telescope Science Institute|We propose a no-cost continuation of our FUSE Cycle 4 snapshot program to find QSOs and AGNs  having ultraviolet fluxes bright enough for detailed follow-up observations with FUSE and the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph.  Our intent is to  find sources for absorption-line studies of the distribution and baryonic content of the low-redshift (z0.1-0.5) intergalactic medium. The start of this program in Cycle4 was particularly promising, with 3 of 10 objects observed being considered for follow-up studies.  We will perform detailed spectroscopic follow-up of the best objects with guaranteed COS time, and we will propose for extended FUSE observations of the brightest objects in the next proposal cycle.  In particular, we want to conduct a better ionO6 baryon census, study the physical conditions of individual absorption systems, determine the ionization mechanisms in the warm-hot intergalactic medium traced by ionO6 and other highly ionized species, and explore the structuredistribution of the ionized IGM.  Increasing the limited number of UV-bright sources currently available for such studies will allow for improved tests of the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution in the present-day universe.
E853|5| | |Young|Rutherford Appleton Laboratory|The causes of stellar activity among giants of masses1.0--3.0msun in and around the K-giant clump are poorly understood. In this region most stars have low rotational velocities yet activity, as measured through X-ray emission, varies by over 3 orders of magnitude. Only recently through the higher sensitivity of modern instruments onboard emphHST and ROSAT have giants previously considered inactive been found to weakly emit ionCiv, ionSiiv ayres97) and  X-rays (schroder) indicating that coronae are ubiquitous in this part of the HR diagram.  This proposal seeks to use the high sensitivity of fuse to understand the activity levels of inactive giants in and around the K giant clump, through a sample of five stars of  different masses and evolutionary states. Coupled with data obtained through the FUSE PI Teams Cool Star Survey the important parameters governing activity amongst clump stars will be isolated.
E897|5| | |Dupke|University of Michigan|Most of the baryons in the local universe are missing in that they are not in galaxies or in the previously detected gaseous phases. These missing baryons are predicted to be in a moderately hot phase, 1E5 to 1E7 K, largely in the form of giant cosmic filaments that connect the denser virialized clusters and groups of galaxies. These filaments can be detected through absorption lines they produce in the spectra of background AGNs. Models show that the highest covering fraction of such filaments occurs in superclusters and the archive has two AGNs projected behind superclusters, both of which show absorption systems  (in LyalphaLybetaOVI) at the supercluster redshift. These results are impressive considering that these AGNs were not even optimally located. Following upon this success, we selected the best targets that lie close to the expected central axis of supercluster filaments to search for OVI and Lyman series absorption lines  with FUSE. This study will expand our archival sample by a factor of 4 and will be complemented by an approved HST program to search for Lyalpha absorbers.
E900|5| | |Blair|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to continue an unbiased ultraviolet survey of supernova remnants in the Magellanic Clouds that was begun in Cycle 4.  Work with FUSE indicates that optical andor X-ray characteristics of supernova remnants are not always good predictors of the objects that will be bright and detectable in the UV.  This survey proposal will continue to test this conclusion by obtaining spectra of additional Magellanic Cloud remnants with a broad range of radio, optical, and X-ray properties. Previously observed objects and remnants with known high extinction (or high column densities) are the only objects eliminated from consideration. A standard request of 0 ks per object using the LWRS aperture is used for the survey, reaching a limiting flux in OVI lambda1032 about a factor of 100 below the flux observed for the LMC remnant N49.  To date in our Cycle 4 survey program D904 we have obtained significant detections of OVI in 5 out of 11 objects observed. In this proposal, we request time to observe any of the candidate objects in D904 not observed in Cycle 4. The time and number of targets listed is thus an upper limit to the actual request.
E903|5| | |Dupuis|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to conduct a survey of high latitude hydrogen-rich atmosphere white dwarfs. The selected stars sample a wide range of effective temperatures and surface gravities and will allow us to better characterize the metal abundance patterns during the early phases of the cooling of a white dwarf. Metals in radiative white dwarf atmospheres are tracers of diffusion processes, but abundance patterns in white dwarfs observed to date are generally not in strict accordance with theoretical predictions. Only an increased sample of white dwarfs with accurate abundance measurements will help us put some order in the somewhat confusing current situation. For instance, this would help us to assess the role of residual mass loss in hot white dwarfs for which a convincing direct evidence is still lacking.
E937|5| | |Bennett|University of Colorado|We propose to observe a reasonably complete sample of northern, late-type, mostly supergiant, binaries with FUV-bright B-type companions, as a Survey and Supplemental Program. The objective is to determine stellar masses of a diverse sample of massive, evolved, late-type stars accurate to 1 a category of stars for which few, accurate stellar masses are known. A secondary goal is to determine mass loss rates of the stellar winds of these evolved stars. These supergiant binary systems are important, fundamental stellar laboratories,  useful in verifying and constraining models of stellar structure and evolution.  We will proceed by determining accurate radial velocity orbits of the early-type companions. The program stars are all selected from the PIs DAO radial velocity program (the Precise Mass Project) target list, and have been extensively observed in the optical for nearly a decade. All the DAO binaries have primary radial velocity orbits determined, or have sufficient optical observations available such that these orbits can be well-determined. Therefore, the single observation of the companions FUV spectrum proposed here will suffice to determine the companions orbit and thus the stellar mass ratio. Some of the target stars eclipse, and for these binaries, accurate individual stellar masses will be directly obtained. Masses of the remaining systems will be obtained from optical interferometry; all these binaries are planned to be observed by NPOI for this purpose.  The proposed FUSE observations are an essential link in the process of determining accurate masses of these evolved stars.
E949|5| | |Peters|University of Southern California|We propose a survey of Algol-type interacting binaries with  FUSE.  The observing list contains 15 systems with  deltage40^o for which systemic parameters are known. The program stars  span the range from early-type contact systems that will eventually become conventional Algols to wide binaries in an advanced evolutionary state with prominent accretion disks. Some physical parameters that can be obtained include the ionization temperature and density in the accretion disk, domain of infall (gas stream), high temperature plasma on the trailing  side of the system, and in certain systems the splash zone. We will look for the presence of ionO6 absorption and assess the phase interval over which it is observed. Emission from this ion has already been found in  FUSE observations of three Algols (V356Sgr, TTHya, and RYPer) during total eclipse and confirms the presence of a sim300,000K plasma abovebelow the orbital plane. In accordance with the policy on the  FUSE Survey and Supplementary Program, the observations will be obtained at random phases, but we request 5 visits of each target in order to secure good phase coverage and maximize the probability of obtaining data at interesting phases, such as the interval containing the mass outflow in the splash region where a tangentially-impacting gas stream is deflected off of the mass gainers photosphere.  The physical parameters that are obtained in this project will constrain future 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of mass flow in Algols.  This project will build upon the successful one (Z902) carried through in FUSE Cycle3.
E950|5| | |Espey|Trinity College Dublin|absorption lines from many different ionisation levels. This, combined with the FUV being the best region to study the hot components and the lack of observations of extragalactic symbiotics, makes them ideal candidates for a FUSE survey.
E957|5| | |Jones|University of Western Ontario|Be and Be stars rotate rapidly and are associated with gaseous circumstellar matter.  Often the circumstellar material has a disk-like distribution, but the physical processes that form and maintain these structures are not well understood.  Be and Be stars also share some other common characteristics, and some Be stars occupy a region of the HR diagram similar to the Be stars suggesting a possible connection to the traditional Be stars. We wish to pursue this potential connection by acquiring FUV spectra of a number of Be stars in the Magellanic Clouds.  These observations will form the first data set of FUV spectra for the Be stars.  To analyze the data, we will employ a new, sophisticated, non-LTE, axisymmetric radiative transfer code to model the spectral lines arising from the extended circumstellar material surrounding such stars. By predicting spectral line profiles and comparing these predictions with observed line profiles, we can decipher the physical parameters of this circumstellar material. Using our FUV data, combined with other existing optical and IR data, we will be better able to constrain our models and greatly improve our understanding of the Be stars.
E989|5| | |Froning|University of Colorado|Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are a nearby, non-obscured population of systems in which the physics of accretion, particularly disk accretion, can be studied.  FUV observations of CVs target the disk, disk winds and the white dwarf (WD); with FUSE, we can address questions concerning the structure of the disk, the driving mechanism of the winds, and the physical interaction between the disk and WD that cannot be addressed through ground-based observations.  Over its lifetime, FUSE has been used to observe numerous CVs.  These studies of individual objects have produced important results, but a broad examination of the FUV properties of CVs is necessary to distinguish class-dependent characteristics from those particular to the history and structure of individual systems.  In Cycle 4, we were awarded FUSE observing time to survey disk-accreting CVs.  Of our list of 20 objects, 5 have been observed to date, suggesting that about half of our targets may be observed by the end of Cycle 4, at which point that program will terminate.  We propose here to continue the FUV survey by submitting a list of CVs that will round out samples of the various CV sub-classes.  Our ongoing analysis --- using the survey targets plus observations from publicly-available individual programs --- employs existing stellar, disk, and wind models to characterize the FUV properties of the white dwarfs, accretion disks, and outflows in CVs as a function of viewing inclination, binary geometry, mass accretion rate, and evolutionary history.  Initial results will be presented in Fall 2003 and we anticipate submission of the final results by early 2005.
F005|6| | |Savage|University of Wisconsin|A recent FUSE snapshot observation reveals that HE,0153--4520 z_  QSO  0.451) is the third brightest moderate redshift (z > 0.4) QSO at FUV wavelengths. The line of sight to HE,0153--4520 provides an outstanding opportunity to obtain information on EUV absorption lines formed in the highly ionized IGM. Our proposed 250 ksec integration will build on our recent successful detection of Ne VIII absorption in a multi-phase system at z 0.20701 toward HE,0226--4110 (z_ QSO  0.497).  The observations of HE,0153--4520 will allow access to EUV lines of O II, O III, O IV, N IV, and Ne VIII in addition to FUV lines of H I, C II, C III, N II, N III, O I, and O VI. Access to a range of ion states is crucial for determining the origin(s) of the ionization and the baryonic content of the highly ionized IGM. Studies of the physical conditions and ionization of IGM absorption-line systems are an essential step for observational cosmology to make progress in understanding whether the highly ionized IGM is a major reservoir of baryons in the low redshift universe. There are only a few QSOs with z > 0.4 for which a study as detailed as the one proposed here can be conducted.
F016|6| | |Hutchings|NRC of Canada|We propose to observe the luminous LMC X-ray binary X0535-668, which consists of a highly interacting Be neutron-star pair. During periastron passage in the very eccentric 16.65-day orbit (e>0.7), the neutron star plunges into the envelope of the Be star. Optical and IUE studies have shown that significant changes occur in the emission at all wavelengths. FUSE spectra will allow us to sample a wide range of ionization states to see how various species vary with orbital phase and hence infer their origin within the system. Study of OVI resonance lines around the orbit will give information on mass loss from the system through its variable stellar wind and how it changes through the eccentric orbit. With FUSE data it will also be possible to detect any cool H_2 envelope that may surround the system.
F018|6| | |Lehner|University of Wisconsin - Madison|In contrast with high redshift studies of the IGM, observations of low z absorption systems provide the opportunity to examine the IGMgalaxy connection in great detail. From STIS E140ME230M observations, we have detected 4 metal systems toward the quasar PKS,0312-77 (z 0.223). One of them is a Lyman limit system (LLS; log N(ionH1) > 17.3) at z 0.20258, which shows one of the strongest ionO6 system ever detected and several elements in different ionization stages, implying a multiphase structure of the gas. This LLS is therefore well suited for a study of the atomic abundances and ionization state. It also provides the rare chance to compare the metallicity in the LLS and in the galaxy that we suspect gives rise to the LLS. The ionH1 column density remains, however, largely unknown from the STIS spectrum. We therefore request a FUSE spectrum of PKS,0312-77 with good signal-to-noise (SN,simeq 14) in order to have access to the whole Lyman series ionH1 from Lygamma down to the Lyman limit. The FUSE spectrum will also provide the ionS6, ionC3, and ionO1 lines for the LLS. Combining FUSE and STIS observations will provide the unique opportunity to derive the overall metallicity of the LSS, the fractions and kinematics of ionized gas, and to compare the abundances of the associated galaxy with the LLS. Our proposed observations will also complete ionO6 surveys at low z to ga 20 mAA.
F020|6| | |Werner|University of Tuebingen|The very first attempt to measure the iron abundance of a hot hydrogen-deficient post-AGB star arrived at a surprising result. Based on the absence of Fe lines in a FUSE spectrum of the PG,1159-type central star of the planetary nebula K1-16 we could show that this object is Fe-deficient by a factor of at least 10--100. We showed by subsequent FUSE spectroscopy that the same phenomenon is exhibited by two related objects, a WC-PG1159 transition-type star and a so-called PG1159-hybrid star. Here we propose a systematic investigation of PG1159 stars to show if Fe-deficiency is a common phenomenon among these objects. We speculated that the iron underabundance is caused by the destruction of iron through s-process neutron capture as a consequence of a late helium-shell flash. If this is true, then all PG1159 stars should be Fe-deficient, because they all are the outcome of a late helium-shell flash. 
F026|6| | |Wakker|University of Wisconsin Madison|When comparing the inventory of baryons in galaxies with determinations of Omega_b obtained from deuterium and the 3K background radiation, most of the baryons appear to be missing. It appears that they may be hiding in the warmhot intergalactic matter (WHIM), evidence for which may be provided by the detections of redshifted intervening OVI absorption lines. However, many (maybe all) of these OVI absorbers might be associated with extended halos of galaxies andor with galaxy groups. For FUSE cycle 4 we studied several intergalactic OVI absorptions at v<3500kms, only one of which turned out to be not associated with a galaxy. We are now looking at the relation between intergalactic OVI absorption with v<3500kms z<0.012) and nearby galaxies and groups. We find that for impact parameters <350kpc there is strong evidence for associated OVI. We propose to observe four targets in order to a) analyze the physical conditions in the strongest associated OVI absorber, occurring in a pair with an impact parameter of 1kpc, and b) confirm 4 of the 8 tentative detections. This would yield a sample of >25 galaxy-AGN pairs with impact parameter <700kpc and SN>15 spectra, with an almost flat distribution of impact parameters.
F027|6| | |Richter|Bonn University|We request an exposure of two extragalactic targets, Mrk,106 and UGC,4305, in order to measure accurate metal abundances in the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex A. Preliminary results indicate that this object has sub-solar metallicity (<0.3 times solar), making it one of only two clear known examples of infalling intergalactic gas (HVC complex C being the other). At present there are many determinations of ionic abundances for sightlines through complex C summarized by Fox et al. 2004), but unlike what is the case for complexC, we know the distance to complex A (8--10 kpc). Therefore, complex A is the only object for which we can reliably estimate its contribution to the mass flow rate of metal-deficient gas impinging on the Milky Way. As both the infall rate of low-metallicity gas as well as the initial metallicity of this infalling gas are crucial parameters for models of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, a proper determination of the metal abundances in complex A would represent an substantial advance in understanding such models. The two lines of sight we selected represent the best chance to determine the chemical composition of complex A, through measurements of absorption lines of OI, NI, FeII, and SiII.

F034|6| | |Massa|SGT, Inc|We propose to carry out the first high spectral resolution study of wind structure in the fast winds of CSPN which can sample the winds on the key characteristic time-scales. We use available fuse spectra to demonstrate that the wind of HD164963, the central star of NGC6543, is variable on a time scale of sim 4hours. We argue that this variability is probably rooted in the photosphere of the star, is indicative of the behavior of the bulk of the wind material and may play a significant role in shaping the nebula. We are requesting 57.6ks of fuse time to observe approximately 4cycles of this activity, in order to fully characterize its temporal behavior and to assess its physical origin.
F037|6| | |Massa|SGT, Inc|We intend to utilize the unique characteristics of the cepob association and its molecular cloud to examine the dependence of dust properties upon the physical conditions of the gas in which they reside. New and existing fuse observations will be used to examine the remarkable dependence of UV extinction curve morphology and proximity to the molecular could. The fuse data will enable us to quantify this behavior in terms of hydrogen molecular fraction, gas kinetic temperature and the local UV radiation field. 
F049|6| | |Koenigsberger|UNAM Centro de Ciencias Fisicas|HD 5980 is the most luminous binary system in the SMC. The two components of this eclipsing binary are very massive and highly evolved stars whose winds strongly interact. The primary (star A, Msim50 M_) appears to be a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) while the secondary (star B, Msim28 M_) is a Wolf-Rayet star of the WNE subtype. Star As wind has varied systematically over the past 20 years, reaching a maximum mass-loss rate sim10^-3 M_ yr^-1 in 1994, when the system underwent a Deltam_vsim3 mag brightness increase in what is believed to have been an LBV-like eruptive event of star A. In recent years, the collision between the winds from the two stars has been dominated by the wind of star A, but its declining emission-line strength since 1999 suggests that the geometry of the shock cone, which until recently folded around star B, is in the process of inverting its orientation. This phenomenon has never before been observed. We are requesting a time series of observations of HD 5980 at specific orbital phases during a single orbital cycle in order to a) establish the present geometry of the WWC region; b) obtain constraints on the wind structure of star A and star B through the modeling of wind eclipses; and c) obtain information on the line-emitting characteristics of the WWC region. The broad range of ionization potentials of resonance lines present in the FUSE bandpass as well as the fact that some of these lines are not saturated provide unparalleled diagnostic capabilities for addressing these problems.
F060|6| | |Fontaine|Universite de Montreal|There are currently 33 hot B subdwarf (sdB) stars which are known to exhibit low-amplitude (a few to tens of mmag), short-period (100-500 s), multiperiodic luminosity variations caused by acoustic mode instabilities. These pulsations are thought to be driven by an opacity bump linked to the presence of a local enhancement of the iron and other iron-peak elements) abundance in the envelopes of sdB stars. Such an enhancement results quite naturally from the diffusive equilibrium between gravitational settling and radiative support in the stellar envelope. Nevertheless, surveys for pulsating sdB stars show that variable and nonvariable objects with similar effective temperatures and gravities coexist in the log g-Teff diagram. This puzzling result suggests that an additional parameter, perhaps a weak stellar wind, might affect the extent of the iron reservoir and thus the ability of the latter to drive pulsations in sdB stars. Fortunately, it is expected that such a wind might also leave its mark on the photospheric heavy element abundance patterns. The intended FUSE observations will 1) permit a direct comparison of the heavy element abundance patterns in variable and nonvariable stars of similar atmospheric parameters, 2) provide a consistency check with our wind models, and 3) provide a test of the currently-favored explanation for the driving of the observed pulsations.
F074|6| | |Sankrit|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose to observe two locations in N49, one of the brightest supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The first region encompasses a supernova ejecta knot that has overtaken the blast wave. The properties of such knots, and their relationship with the parent supernova remnant are as yet poorly understood. The FUSE spectrum of the eject knot in N49 will reveal its kinematic properties and allow us to estimate the dynamic pressure of the shock. We will search for neon, sulphur and silicon lines in the FUSE spectra of this chemically enriched region and constrain the abundances of these elements with respect to oxygen. The second location is on an intermediate velocity (sim700kms^: -1 ) non-radiative shock. From our proposed observation, we will be able to obtain the oxygen kinetic temperature from the OVI emission line profile. Combined with X-ray data, this will allow us to estimate the electron-ion equilibration in the shock. These regions have been selected on the basis of their X-ray emission seen in textitChandra images; they have little or no optical emission. In addition to addressing important questions about different kinds of shocks found in supernova remnants, our proposed observations will supplement the existing FUSE observations of bright optical regions of N49. The old and new spectra will yield the first complete picture, at high spectral resolution, of the OVI emission from a supernova remnant.
F089|6| | |Walborn|Space Telescope Science Institute|The new classification O2 was recently introduced to describe the earliest-type optical spectra. Subsequent work on giants of that type in the Magellanic Clouds has revealed a range of relative CNO and HeH line strengths, and three of them have been reclassified as ON2III. Available HST data show corresponding anomalies in the stellar winds. Modeling of these spectra shows that the phenomena correspond to abundance differences most likely caused by mixing of CNO-cycled material to the surfaces of evolving, very massive stars. We shall investigate the spectrum of one of the LMC nitrogen-rich objects, which is also helium-rich, at FUSE wavelengths, to search for and model additional relevant wind and photospheric diagnostics in the rich FUV spectral range. Two normal LMC O2 giants and an ON2 in the SMC have already been observed with FUSE and will serve as comparison objects; optical and HST data are also available for all four stars to support unified (windatmosphere) analysis. Another LMC ON2 has higher reddening, so that our target is the best case for FUSE investigation. These very hot N-rich objects may be evolving homogeneously and in any event will provide vital information about the evolution of the most massive stars, likely including the mixing effects of rotation according to current models. 
F111|6| | |Herczeg|University of Colorado at Boulder|The residual gas content in intermediate-aged optically thin disks (3--100 Myr) is important to the formation and early evolution of terrestrial and giant planet formation, but it is currently poorly constrained. FUV radiation is expected to significantly impact the photochemistry of the disk by photodissociating H_2 and CO and ionizing S, and will determine our ability to detect the gaseous component of the disk. Spitzer offers several emission lines to probe the gas at planet-forming radii of the disks. However, inferring a gas mass from these lines requires accurate measurements of the FUV field, which we can use to model the abundance structure and excitation of the gas. Therefore, we propose to use FUSE to measure the emission from 912--1185 AA for a sample of intermediate-aged solar analogues that have optically thin disks and span the range of timescales when residual gas may still be present. We will use this data, combined with disk models, to measure the gas content in disks from Spitzer spectra, ultimately leading to estimates of the evolution of gas mass with time in the planet forming regions of disks. 
F132|6| | |Gull|NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center|FUSE observations of the star,ecar, and its surrounding stellar ejecta present a unique opportunity to study the FUV properties of recently ejected material from a very massive stellar system and to identify the hot secondary companion. We propose to 1) use the MDRS to obtainecars polar stellar spectrum scattered from the SE lobe, which should provide spectral signature of the mysterious companion star, 2) use the HIRS and MDRS to disentangle the stellar spectrum from the dust-scattered, nebular emission, and 3) obtain the nebular spectrum of the S-condensation, where recent, fast moving ejecta are colliding with previously-ejected, nitrogen-enriched material. This proposal builds on multiple observing programs using FUSE, HSTSTIS, RXTE, CHANDRA, VLTUVES and other ground-based instruments that have followedecar over the recent 5.54-year cycle. These proposed observations, along with improved modeling of this very complex system, will provide new insight on ! the nature of massive (binary) stars in their last stages of stellar evolution and on how they interact with, and enrich, the ISM. Since very massive, Population III stars are thought to be the source of heavy elements and dust in the early Universe, we need a complete description of how stars of extreme mass, such asecar, deposit nucleosynthesis products into the ISM, and how they form dust.
F150|6| | |Charpinet|Observatoire Midi-Pyrnes|We propose to monitor the rapid pulsations of the hot subdwarf B (sdB) star PG 1219+534 in the Far UV using the Time Tag (TTAG) mode of FUSE. The apparent amplitude of a nonradial oscillation mode depends on both the geometry of the mode (through the degree ell) and the wavelength at which it is observed. For hot sdB stars, calculations clearly indicate that the relative mode amplitudes as seen in the optical and in the Far UV strongly discriminates between values of the degree ell, allowing these to be easily determined. Such constraints on the mode identification are otherwise very difficult to obtain from optical multicolor photometry alone, as the discrimination between different ell values is weak when confined in this bandpass. The comparison of the FUV amplitudes of the modes detected by FUSE with their optical counterparts (from existing CFHT data and from planned contemporary observations at the Mt Bigelow 61 Telescope) will lead to an independent determination of the degree ell of the pulsation modes of PG 1219+534. Our goal is to provide, for the first time, a direct test of the predicted mode identification derived from a recent asteroseismic analysis of this star based on optical white light photometry only.
F160|6| | |Kruk|The Johns Hopkins University|The DH and DO abundance ratios have been found to be uniform within the Local Bubble, for lines of sight typically shorter than 100 parsecs. At distances of 100 pc to 1000pc measurements of DH show considerable scatter, and at greater distances the values are well below that of the Local Bubble. FUSE measurements of DO exhibit a trend of decreasing values with increasing distance beyond 100 pc. A consistent framework encompassing the behavior of DH and DO has proven elusive. Measurements of DH, DO, and other elemental abundances in different environments are essential for improving our understanding of chemical evolution within the Galaxy. It has been suggested that some of the seemingly contradictory abundance patterns may be the result of differential depletion of D and H onto dust grains. Unfortunately, relatively few lines of sight beyond the Local Bubble have a velocity structure that is simple enough for reliable measurements to be made, so the present sampling of different Galactic environments is insufficient to disentagle the possible contributing processes. Existing FUSE spectra for the three stars in this program (distances ranging from 400 to 1000 pc) reveal isolated DI lines. Preliminary analyses indicate that log N(DI) > 15, hence N(HI) should be high enough to be determined from the Ly,beta damping profile. This proposal requests additional observing time to obtain signal-to-noise ratios adequate for measuring column densities of HI, DI, OI, NI, and FeII. N(HI) will also be determined from archival IUE, GHRS, or STIS data for of the 3 stars, and compared to that derived from the FUSE Lyman beta profiles.
F169|6| | |McCandliss|The Johns Hopkins University|It has been asserted that the contribution of stars to the metagalactic background radiation, which ionizes most of the baryons in the universe, remains almost completely unknown at all epochs. Here we propose to discover Lyman continuum photons escaping from nearby galaxies. Direct detection of Lyman continuum photons escaping from galaxies at low redshift can provide critical constraint to models of reionization at high redshift, where the first star forming galaxies are thought dominate the process. We have developed a pool of 6 candidate objects with the criteria that the redshift is z > 0.025, the logF_1516 ge -14.1 and the objects are extended in the Sloan survey. We show that with these six objects we will be able to either limit or detect the escape fraction of lyman continuum photons from star forming galaxies at the 5 threshold. This program will significantly reduce the uncertainty in Lyman continuum escape fraction at low redshift.
F173|6| | |Guinan|Villanova University| 
F320|6| | |Brown|University of Colorado, Boulder|We propose a comprehensive FUSE survey of stellar activity levels, as seen in the O VI and C III transition region emission lines, for all known members of the beta Pic Moving Group, which is a 12 million year old subgrouping within the Local Association. This will significantly expand the sample of young active, zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS), A-M dwarfs with measured transition region emission line fluxes. Thus, allowing detailed studies of the influence of stellar activity on the immediate circumstellar environment of very young stars during a crucial phase of protoplanetary system formation, when formation of gas giant planets is thought to be well underway and formation of terrestrial planets just starting. The sample chosen for this study have identical ages and formed together during the same small star formation episode. By studying a sample of low and intermediate mass stars with identical ages and formation history, a clearer determination of the factors controlling stellar magnetic activity can be obtained, thus enabling better characterization of the evolution in stellar activity during the crucial early phases of stellar, circumstellar disk, and protoplanetary system evolution.
F321|6| | |Iping|The Catholic University of America|We propose FUSE observations for a complete binary orbit of three early-type, double-lined spectroscopic binaries in Magellanic Clouds. The spectra obtained will enable quantitative and systematic studies of phase-dependent stellar wind properties, wind collision effects in O+O binaries at lower metallicities, improved radial velocity curves, and FUV spectrophotometric changes as a function of orbital phase. These data will lead to improved mass and radius estimates for some of the most massive stars known. Most massive stars, if not all, are or were members of binary or multiple systems. The proposed systems have very short periods (1.4 - 2.25 days), represent rare, young evolutionary stages of massive stars and binaries, and provide a unique glimpse at some of the most massive systems that form in dense clusters of massive stars. These Magellanic Cloud systems have little reddening and foreground gas, unlike the few known comparable Galactic counterparts.
F323|6| | |Walter|SUNY Stony Brook|Observations of the temporal variability of stellar activity provide important insights into the spatial distribution of stellar active regions, and of the configuration of the stellar magnetic field. We propose to observe the bright partially eclipsing RSCVn system CFTuc for two complete and uninterrupted stellar orbits while it is in the CVZ. Uninterrupted observations are crucial for studying the short term flaring and flux variations of the stellar atmosphere, and to separate secular trends from true periodic phenomena. We will use the radial velocities of the OVI lines to separate the emission of the two stars. Spectral imaging techniques will constrain the location of the emission, and will permit us to determine whether or not the emission comes from close to the stellar surface or from within an extended magnetosphere. The partial eclipses may further constrain the spatial location of the emitting regions. This is the brightest active RSCVn binary within the FUSE CVZ, and as such can serve as a template for interpretation of perhaps better-known systems in less favorable parts of the sky.
F325|6| | |Arav|University of Colorado at Boulder|AGN outflows impact the evolution of supermassive black holes, host galaxies, surrounding IGM, and cluster cooling flows. However, while the theoretical interest in these outflows increased dramatically, we have only weak constraints on the most important properties of real AGN winds kinetic luminosity, chemical abundances and physical conditions. The best approach to advance our understanding of these issues is to execute simultaneous X-ray and FUSE observations of the brightest AGN outflows, which are found in local Seyfert 1 galaxies. Our group has made significant strides in overcoming the major obstacle in analyzing outflow absorption troughs, the velocity-dependent non-black saturation. Thus, we have the ability to extract the essential physical properties from the data of carefully chosen objects. Our FUSE proposal targets the four most promising objects, for which we either have approved Chandra grating time, or a parallel submitted XMM and Astro-E2 proposals. This effort is designed to create a combined UVX-ray data set, which will leave a long lasting FUSE legacy in the field of cosmological structure formation.
F327|6| | |Hoopes|The Johns Hopkins University|Starbursts are a significant component of the present-day universe, and offer unique laboratories for studying the processes that have regulated the formation and evolution of galaxies and the IGM. An All-sky Imaging Survey being conducted by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) has discovered many star-forming galaxies with UV fluxes bright enough for detailed study with FUSE. We propose a Legacy project to obtain high quality (SN > 20) spectra of the 14 most favorable of these bright starbursts with em FUSE in order to form a representative sample of local star forming galaxies which can be compared to galaxies at high redshift. The em FUSE data will be especially valuable to study 1) the coronal-phase gas that may dominate the energetics of starburst-driven superwinds, 2) the properties of the stellar populations in starbursts (including the IMF and burst history), 3) the abundances and chemical evolution history of starbursts, 4) the escape of ionizing radiation from starbursts, 5) the effects of the strong UV radiation field on the formation and destruction of H_2, and 6) the starburst dust-attenuation law in the FUV window. This sample represents a large increase in the inventory of em FUSE spectroscopy of comparable quality for starbursts. This project will capitalize on the synergy between em FUSE and GALEX to build a lasting legacy for research on starbursts at both low- and high-redshift. em FUSE is the only facility that can obtain high resolution UV spectra that measure the global properties of local starbursts.
F329|6| | |Welsh|University of California at Berkeley|We propose to provide a legacy database of far ultraviolet absorption spectra (912 - 1100AA) of 44 bright early-type B stars residing within sim 50pc of the Sun. These spectra will primarily be used to map the physical and chemical characteristics of the neutral and ionized interstellar gas that lies both within and just beyond the contours of the Local Bubble region. Of particular importance will be the detection of the OVI ion, which is known to trace highly ionized, hot (sim 300,000K) interstellar gas. We shall produce plots of the spatial distribution of the OVI ion with respect to the cold and dense neutral boundary to the rarefied Local Bubble cavity. This information will provide new insights into the possible production mechanisms for this ion that is widely believed to be formed at the conductive interfaces of evaporating gas clouds. Our database will also allow study of the spatial distribution of the ions of ArI, OI, FeII, CII, CIII, NI and NII, such that both diffuse neutral and ionized local gas can be probed in order to determine if photo-ionization conditions dominate within the local cavity. These data will also allow an investigation of the gas phase element abundances in the local gas, such that we will be able to compare their relative depletion patterns with both the galactic disk and halo gas. In addition to these prime science objectives these data will also provide a large database of observations of local H_2 molecular absorption, as well as a large, high SN set of early-type star spectra that can be modelled with appropriate stellar atmospheres.
F907|6| | |Smith|The Catholic University of America|Gamma Cas, the classical Be prototype, is a highly unusual X-ray object for which there is no known counterpart in the Galaxy. The next best places to search for analog objects are the Magellanic Clouds. The Clouds have uniform distances, little intervening reddening, and an average age similar to gamma,Cas (10-15 Myr). We have identified 5 stars in the SMC whose light curves exhibit peculiar cycles similar to gamma,Cas and, in some cases, whose peculiar spectroscopic properties may be conducive to X-ray production. This is an extension of an approved HSTSTIS program to obtain mid-UV spectra of these objects. We plan soon to extend our study to GALEX and to the X-ray region ( Chandra). Here we outline a plan to obtain FUSE snapshots of these objects in order to better place these objects in the HR Diagram by defining their SEDs over a wide wavelength range, to look for evidence of high-energy activity, such as anchored, corotating clouds, and for the presence of evolved subluminous companions.
F909|6| | |Chayer|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose FUSE observations of a sample of hot subdwarf B stars (sdB) in order to carry out an abundance analysis of heavy elements and see how their abundance patterns emerge from the observations. It is a well known fact that the atmospheres of these extreme horizontal branch stars exhibit abundance anomalies. Diffusion processes such as gravitational settling, radiative levitation, weak stellar winds, and accretion have been proposed to explain the abundance anomalies. Our goal is to identify which mechanisms operate in the atmospheres of these stars, study their interactions, understand the abundance patterns, and ultimately, constrain the structure of the atmospheres of sdB stars. With this proposal we want to pursue the goal of our FUSE proposal E152 by doubling the number of stars in our sample. To study and interpret the abundance patterns in sdB stars, we need a large sample of stars with atmospheric parameters that cover the whole effective temperature and gravity domains for this type of stars 20,000 K leq T_:  eff  leq 40,000 K ; 5.0 leq log g leq 6.5). To achieve a thorough abundance analysis we need FUSE observations, because many resonance lines of elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and many iron peak elements are only visible in the FUV range for the effective temperatures of interest. This study will not only provide new insights into the stellar atmosphere structure of sdB stars, but also to the evolution of galaxies since these stars are the most important candidates for the source of the UV excess in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges.
F912|6| | |Redfield|McDonald Observatory| 
F913|6| | |Dupuis|The Johns Hopkins University|We propose to expand a survey of DA white dwarfs cooler than about 0,000K initiated in FUSE Cycle 4. These stars have not been studied as extensively than hotter white dwarfs by FUSE as they tend to be fainter and are not as good background sources for deuterium studies. We will search for the presence of trace elements such as C, N, Si, and Fe in the atmosphere of these cooler white dwarfs. Previous observations of white dwarfs in this temperature range have revealed surprisingly high metallicity in a subset of stars. This is in spite of the dwindling of support by selective radiative acceleration at these temperatures. The current wisdom about this phenomenon is that these stars are accreting matter, either interstellar or circumstellar, which then pollutes their atmospheres. These observations will allow us to potentially discover new cool metal-enriched DAs and further our understanding of this peculiar phenomenon. These observations will also allow us to improve our understanding of quasi-molecular satellites which become prominent in the wings of Lyman beta and Lyman gamma profiles at these temperatures.
F914|6| | |Chu|University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|0 Doradus is an archetypical example of a starburst region. At a distance of 50 kpc, its stellar content and interstellar structure can be resolved and studied in detail. The mechanical energies injected by massive stars have yielded a large amount of hot, X-ray-emitting gas in 30 Dor. Optical and X-ray observations of 30 Dor reveal a good correlation between shell structures and bright X-ray emission. We request FUSE observations of 30 Dor to use emission lines to study both the physical conditions and kinematic properties of the hot gas in X-ray-bright shells. In particular, we will use the OVI emission lines, in conjunction with complementary X-ray and optical data, to study SNR shocks and interfaces between hot (>10^6 K) gas and the surrounding cooler (10^4 K) shell gas. The results will aid in our understanding of the generation and conditions of hot gas in distant, unresolved starburst regions.
F915|6| | |Bennett|University of Colorado at Boulder|We propose to observe all remaining cool, non-interacting supergiant binaries with hot companions from the Parsons & Ake (1998) catalog, satisfying certain feasibility requirements, that were not targets in FUSE program E937, as a Survey and Supplemental Program. The objective is to determine stellar masses of a diverse sample of massive, evolved, late-type stars and their B-type main sequence companions, accurate to 1--2 accurate stellar masses are known for any cool supergiants. An important secondary goal is to determine mass-loss rates of the stellar winds of these evolved stars by observation of wind absorption features superimposed on the hot companions FUV continua. These supergiant binary systems are important, fundamental stellar laboratories useful in verifying and constraining models of stellar structure and evolution. We will proceed by measuring the hot stars radial velocity, preferably at more than one epoch (we will propose continuing observations for FUSE Cycles 7--8). The orbits of the cool supergiant primaries of the target binaries are being accurately determined from the PIs decade-long radial velocity program on the DAO 1.2m McKellar coude telescope. Then the companions velocity amplitude, K_2, can be found from a single radial velocity observation, although multiple observations are preferable. Nevertheless, a single observation will suffice to determine the mass ratio of the stars to 2--4 separated in orbital phase, the accuracy will be 1--2 Some target stars eclipse, and for these accurate stellar masses can be directly obtained. Masses of the remaining stars will be obtained from optical interferometry; these binaries are on the NPOI target list. With the loss of HSTSTIS, bf FUSE is the only available UV spectrograph and therefore, the proposed program is essential to determining fundamental, accurate masses of cool supergiants. 
F918|6| | |Thilker|The Johns Hopkins University|NASAs Spitzer Space Telescope and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) now provide high-resolution MIR--FIR and FUV--NUV probes for the internal structure of nearby galaxies, effectively constraining the spatial distribution of dust and stars of varied age. Both observatories have committed to a common Legacy project to ascertain the star formation activity and its effect on dust properties in a large representative sample of local targets. This effort is called SINGS -- the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey. Highlighted within SINGS are a collection of 75 optically- or IR-bright star-forming regions, for which dedicated high-resolution IR 5-37mum) spectroscopy will be obtained. In order to best capitalize on this opportunity to gauge the entire (stellar and dust) FUV--FIR SED for such intermediate luminosity starbursts, we propose FUSE survey observations for 19 optically-selected, extranuclear star-forming regions in six SINGS galaxies. The entire proposed sample benefits from completed GALEX FUV and NUV imaging, which we have used to assess feasibility. The extranuclear SINGS star-forming regions span a representative range of key physical parameters. The FUSE spectra of these star-forming regions, when combined with GALEX and Spitzer observations, will constrain the massive stellar content in each object and permit determination of the UV attenuation law. We will also explore the possibility of using the equivalent width of ionN4, ionC3, and ionP5 winds lines as metallicity indicators, with application at high redshift. This project complements a related Cycle 6 proposal to observe the central regions in a larger fraction of the SINGS galaxies. The proposed dataset will have exceptional archival value, given the GALEXSINGS Legacy program.
F919|6| | |Thilker|The Johns Hopkins University|NASAs Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) is conducting wide-field imaging and spectroscopic surveys in FUV (1350-1750AA) and NUV 1750-3000AA) bands. A dedicated campaign to image 300+ nearby galaxies (Nearby Galaxy Survey, NGS) is nearly complete. We propose FUSE survey observations for the central region of 25 galaxies with completed GALEX imaging, which are also being observed at .6-160mum as part of either the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS) or Mid-IR Hubble Atlas (MIR-atlas) projects. Our sample galaxies span a wide range of star formation activity in the local universe. The FUSE spectra, when combined with GALEX and Spitzer observations, will constrain the star formation history (SFH) in the central region of each target, placing the sample into an evolutionary context. The SFH will be estimated via direct comparison with reddened Starburst99 population synthesis predictions, improved by the FUSE spectral library of hot stars. Our analysis will be based on the FUV to UV continuum slope, spectral line diagnostics, and the overall FUV--FIR SED. We will concurrently determine the FUV attenuation law with unprecedented accuracy for ordinary star-forming galaxies, and test for correlation of the extinction law with SFH and galaxy type, given that copious star formation may modify dust grain properties. The combination of FUSE, GALEX, and Spitzer data provides a rare opportunity to decisively test and calibrate the IRX-beta attenuation-reddening relation, which may be used to gauge UV extinction for >10^7 galaxies detected in the GALEX imaging surveys. Our GALEX FUV, NUV imagery was used to select targets and will aid interpretation of spatially integrated FUSE spectra. Radial profiles and spatially-resolved SEDs in UV--IR bands will allow us to extend our results beyond the circumnuclear region. The proposed dataset will have additional archival value, given the GALEXSINGS Legacy program.
F927|6| | |Iping|The Catholic University of America|We propose a survey of close, massive binary stars not previously observed by FUSE. The target sample includes detached and semi-detached systems that are at pre and post Roche lobe overflow evolutionary stages. The binaries are generally double-line spectroscopic binaries, many are eclipsing systems, with well-determined orbits and periods in the range 1.6 - 12 days. The far-UV spectra will be used to determine stellar wind mass loss rates and terminal velocities from species tracing a range of wind ionization states. The spectral features will be modelled to study photospheric abundances, evidence for CNO enhancements as the result of mass transfer, and measure projected rotational velocities. We will look for spectroscopic evidence of mass transfer and wind-wind collision effects. The proposed observing plan provides the possibility for each system to be observed more than once to sample different orbital phases and spectral variability. The ISM properties of the ! sight lines will also be analyzed.
G003|7| | |Oliveira|Johns Hopkins University|Measurements of the DH and DO ratios have been shown to be remarkably constant up to log N(H) 19.2, which corresponds roughly to the limits of the Local Bubble. Between 19.2 < log N(H) < 20.6, these ratios present a large scatter, while for log N(H) > 20.6 DH and DO seem to be constant again, albeit with values roughly half that of the Local Bubble. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these variations, a global consistent picture of these abundance patterns is still missing. The low yield of high column density sightlines suitable for accurate DH measurements has been a major barrier to progress in this area. This derives from the extreme difficulty of finding suitable targets at these high N(H), both in terms of DI not being obscured by either HI or H_2 absorption and having data available to determine reliable N(HI) from Lyman alpha.  This proposal requests additional observing time to obtain signal-to-noise ratios adequate for determining the column densities of DI, NI, OI, and FeII, along three high N(H) sightlines that have been previously observed by FUSE. Preliminary analyses of the current datasets show that these sightlines are suitable for DI measurements and that they may have high DH ratios (> 1E-5).  Existing high resolution HST/STIS data for the three sightlines will be used to determine N(HI) along two of the sightlines (N(HI) has been published for the other one) as well as to model the velocity structure along the sightlines. These datasets will also allow us to determine the abundances of species that do not have unsaturated transitions in the FUSE bandpass (SI, NiII, etc.). Additionally, N(OI) derived from the weaker, but with a more reliable f-value, 1356AA transition in the STIS bandpass will be compared to the one derived from the 974AA transition in the FUSE bandpass.
G006|7| | |Gull|Goddard Space Flight Center|Eta Carinae has long been suspected to be a massive binary system, but the hot companion has eluded detection until now. Our FUSE Cycle 4 observations have revealed the hot companion of eta Car for the first time. FUV spectra show that the companion is consistent with a late O or WR star, possibly nitrogen rich. FUSE observations of eta Car now span one complete binary orbit (5.54 years). Future FUSE spectra will allow us to begin to separate cyclical binary orbit variability from long-term secular changes. We propose two Cycle 7 observations about six months apart to place further constraints on the hot companion, perhaps obtaining spectral classification and radial velocity measurements which could lead to direct mass estimates for the system. These objectives are supported by spectral analysis of STIS observations from 1998.0 - 2004.5 that are yielding radial velocity curves for the wind-wind interaction in the binary system.
G007|7| | |Henry|Johns Hopkins University|We show that FUSE is capable of providing unique data on the diffuse ultraviolet background radiation shortward of Lyman Alpha.  This is the only way of confirming previous Voyager measurements of the diffuse background, which are contaminated with Lyman Beta because of the poor (28 AA) spectral resolution of Voyager.  Confirmation of the Voyager measurements is important in its own right, but also may be of unique importance to cosmology, as the Voyager measurements show a drastically different picture of the diffuse ultraviolet background short of Lyman Alpha, compared with what is seen longward of Lyman Alpha, suggesting the possibility that the general diffuse background longward of Lyman Alpha is at least partially of cosmological origin (intergalactic hydrogen recombination radiation).  While we have just, once again, been successful in obtaining GALEX observing time longward of Lyman Alpha, FUSE provides our only opportunity to test the strength of our case shortward of Lyman Alpha.
G015|7| | |Redfield|University of Texas Austin|We propose to observe six nearby high latitude stars to measure the variation in ionization structure within the Local Interstellar Cloud LIC) and other neighboring clouds.  Of particular interest are the first three ionization stages of carbon and nitrogen, which are controlled by the (partially shielded) interstellar radiation field. FUSE is the optimal instrument for this kind of study because only FUSE can access the resonance lines of CIII (977.020AA), NII 1083.99AA), and NIII (989.789AA). Since all of our targets have high resolution STIS or GHRS spectra, the velocity structure of all components are well characterized.  With both the HST and FUSE spectra, we can measure column densities of several ions, including CI FUSE and HST), CII (FUSE and HST), CIII (FUSE), NI (FUSE and HST), NII (FUSE), and NIII (FUSE), sampling many important ionization stages.  These observations will detect differences in the ionization structure within the LIC and other nearby clouds, and we will test whether these differences can be explained by different amounts of hydrogen continuum shielding of photoionizing radiation from bright sources like betaCen.  The ionization structure of the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) is vital to understanding the formation, energy balance, and evolution of the LISM.
G017|7| | |Jenkins|Princeton University|We propose to observe 2 stars behind a complex of unusually cold HI clouds that produce shadows in the background 21-cm line radiation.  These clouds are not the classical dense molecular clouds that are known for their strong CO line emission.  Our objective is to learn how this material arrives at temperatures well below those given by standard theoretical predictions.  By measuring the ortho-to-para ratio of H_2, which equilibrates very slowly with the local kinetic temperature, we can determine if the gas has been cold for a long time, as one might expect if the clouds are stable and heating rate is abnormally low, or, alternatively, if the coldness is a very temporary condition brought about by rapid responses to turbulent expansions and compressions.  In addition to using FUSE to measure the abundances and rotational excitations of H_2 and CO, we plan to compare the gas-phase abundances of Fe and O, so that we can test the proposition that there might be a deficiency of grains that emit energetic photoelectrons that would normally heat cold clouds.
G018|7| | |Knauth|Northwestern University|N_2 is the most abundant molecule in environments as diverse as the atmospheres of Earth and Titan.  Yet, until recently, little was known about its abundance in the ISM since the only accessible N_2 transitions lie in the far-UV.  Utilizing the high-sensitivity of the FUSE detectors, Knauth and collaborators reported on the first detections of interstellar N_2 toward the stars HD124314 and 20Aql.  The observed N_2 fractional abundances are almost two orders of magnitude larger than expected from models of interstellar nitrogen chemistry for diffuse clouds and do not agree with predictions from dark cloud chemistry either.  Here, we propose high SN (30), SiC only, FP-SPLIT observations toward four carefully chosen moderately-reddened stars which have substantial amounts of interstellar CO (spanning almost two orders of magnitude in column density).  The N_2 detection threshold N(N_2) > 6x10^12 cm^-2 is a factor of five more sensitive than previous measurements.  Our proposed observations will set stringent limits on the N_2 abundance along sightlines with substantial amounts of molecular material and provide clues toward either new N_2 production routes or for modification of the poorly known production andor destruction reaction rates.  
G020|7| | |Bowen|Princeton University|We propose searching for OVI (and Lyman beta) absorption lines from the halos (simeq 8-280h radii) of five nearby galaxies, using background QSOs or AGN as probes. The detection of OVI around galaxies is likely to have important implications for our derstanding of how galaxies form and evolve. Models predict that gas creting to galaxies from the formation of galactic large scale structure (or om, g., the assimilation of dwarf satellites) should be shock-heated to mperatures at which oxygen would be detectable as OVI. At the same me, galaxies should also be feeding hot gas back into the intergalactic medium via winds driven by supernovae. Some of these processes may well be responsible for the High Velocity Cloud complexes seen in the Milky Way.  Despite the importance of such mechanisms, however, we have very little direct evidence of how hot, metal-enriched gas behaves close to a galaxy, or even that it exists beyond a few kpc. With this proposal, we seek to search the halos of various types of galaxies for OVI-absorbing gas, using the few probes which are bright enough to be observed by FUSE and which are at declinations above 50 deg.  Although the number of galaxies probed will be small, our observations will provide a first estimate of how far OVI extends from a galaxy, its covering fraction, whether the column density declines with distance, and whether the absorption complexes show unusual velocity structure, as might be expected from the more dynamical processes such as galactic outflows.
G021|7| | |Skillman|University of Minnesota|FUSE has discovered a putative offset between the neutral and ionized gas phase chemical abundances of nearby dwarf starburst galaxies.  This important and intriguing result is in the sense that the neutral gas phase abundances are significantly (approx 1 dex) lower than the HII region abundances.  Thus, the starburst environment may be surrounded by a lower metallicity halo.  This could be a result of either chemical pollution of the medium closely surrounding the starburst or a metallicity gradient from the inner (relatively) metal rich galaxy to an outer metal poor halo.  This potentially high impact result is not yet secure because the neutral gas absorption lines may yield underestimates of the abundances due to ionization, depletion, andor saturation effects affecting the various chemical elements.  For several reasons, oxygen is the ideal element to concentrate on, and by observing multiple OI lines with different oscillator strengths - and thereby addressing saturation concerns - we can obtain a secure absorption line oxygen abundance for the neutral gas phase for the first time.  A deep FUSE integration of a carefully selected and previously observed target (NGC3353 equiv Haro3 equiv Mrk35) will allow us to measure neutral oxygen lines over a range in oscillator strength, and thus support or question this very important FUSE discovery.
G023|7| | |Ayres|University of Colorado|Late-type supergiants represent the terminal evolutionary stage of short-lived high-mass stars.  We shouldnt expect their coronal magnetic behavior to be anything like the long-lived low-mass Sun.  Many GK supergiants fulfill that expectation by displaying prominent cool wind absorptions in Mg II, and little if any coronal X-ray emission.  Yet, a number of early-G supergiants do exhibit symptoms of solar-type coronal behavior, down to details like redshifted transition zone (T 10^5K) emission lines.  Even among these active supergiants, however, L_XL_CIV ratios curiously are depressed an order of magnitude below solar-like stars.  The winds of the inactive supergiants, and the X-ray deficiency of the active class, are important issues in stellar high-energy astrophysics; where the diagnostic power of FUSE spectroscopy can be put to good use.  We propose to add to the mix two key late-type supergiants---Beta Cam G0Ib) and Beta Ind (K1II)---not previously observed by FUSE; and a new pointing on the archetype hybrid chromosphere star Alpha TrA K2II), recorded by FUSE in 00 and 02, but now a planned target (as is Beta Ind) for an upcoming joint Chandra HST imaging program.  
G025|7| | |Iping|Catholic University of America|We propose a series of FUSE observations of the Wolf-Rayet + O star binary CQ Cephei to determine the structure of the bow shock zone formed when the winds of the two hot stars collide.  CQ Cephei has the shortest period of all the known WR+O binaries and would be the first WN+O binary to be studied in this way by FUSE.  Analysis of the FUSE spectra will lead to improved constraints on orbital parameters and on characteristics of the WR star itself (wind momentum, mass-loss rate, and abundances). Of particular importance in the FUSE wavelength range is the large number of emission lines with different ionization potentials from abundant elements, ranging from OVI, S IV, P V, C III, to N II.  The S and P lines are important because these elements are produced only in SN explosions and are not enhanced by CNO processes.  The proposed observations will cover a significant part of the .64-day orbital period to map the wind interaction zone from phase-dependent spectral variations.
G035|7| | |Gaetz|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|The supernova remnant 1E0102.2-7219 in the Small Magellanic Cloud is the best studied O-rich remnant after Cas-A, having been observed in bands from radio through X-ray.  In spite of its simple appearance round remnant, bright reverse shock) the remnants structure is complex.  X-ray kinematics suggest an expanding toroid viewed nearly on-axis, while optical kinematics suggest an expanding shell with a bubbly internal structure.  We will use FUSE to examine the velocity structure on sight-lines through the center of the remnant which will complement our Cycle 3 observations of the bright X-ray ring.  These observations will provide OVI kinematic data for comparison to the optical OIIIf and X-ray grating kinematic data.  The MDRS slit samples a significant fraction of the projected area, but is small enough to isolate interesting structure.  Recent OIIIf proper motion data yield an expansion center near the X-ray knot in a central X-ray filament, and the kinematic center is included in all the proposed observations.  This will allow a search for evidence (such as variability) for a compact central object which should have been produced by the collapse of a massive star.
G036|7| | |Moffat|Universite de Montreal|All hot, luminous stars drive strong winds, that have a major impact on their evolution and their surroundings. This was especially important in the early Universe, that was dominated by massive stars with very low metallicity. But what were the actual mass-loss rates then  Small-scale structures (clumps) are considered as the main factor which can reduce the observed mass-loss rate, by a factor of at least 3.  No one knows whether and how clumping changes with the decreasing fraction of wind-driving metals.  We propose to approach this important question by detecting clumps in hot-star winds of 2 selected single WN stars in the SMC, where metallicity is one-tenth solar.
G039|7| | |Herald|Johns Hopkins University|Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, thought to descend from the most massive stars, are important drivers of galactic evolution through their injection of mechanical energy, chemically enriched material and ionizing photons into their surroundings.  They are a key to understanding massive stellar and galactic evolution, as well as nucleosynthesis processes.  An important aspect in the understanding of WR stars is the influence of the metallicity of their environment on their parameters and evolution.  To shed light on this question, we wish to study and compare two like samples of WR stars from environments of differing metallicity; the Milky Way and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).  FUSE observations provide crucial diagnostic lines for measuring mass-loss parameters, effective temperatures, and certain abundances.  We will model the FUSE spectra to derive the stellar parameters of these objects, which will help answer the following outstanding questions; i) What effect does metallicity have, if any, on the wind properties of WR stars  (ii) Do wind clumping parameters (which directly affect derived mass-loss rates) determined from far-UV diagnostics agree with those derived from IR diagnostics  (iii) Do observed WR parameters agree with predictions of theoretical evolutionary models  (iv) Do observed SMC WR properties agree with those currently adopted in low-metallicity stellar synthesis models  (v) Do X-ray parameters derived from stellar atmosphere models agree with observed X-ray fluxes.
G044|7| | |Shull|University of Colorado|One of the important discoveries of FUSE and HST was the detection of intergalactic OVI absorbers, possibly associated with the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) at 10^(5-6)K.  Danforth & Shull (2005) found 40 OVI absorbers in 31 sightlines, spanning Delta z approx 2.2, and estimated that 5-10 gas. With a steep column-density distribution calN (N_OVI) proportional to N_OVI^-2.2 pm 0.1, weak absorbers contain much of the total mass. Thus, it is important to measure OVI absorbers down to weak levels (Nosix approx 10^13 cd) in order to (1) obtain an accurate baryon census of the hot IGM; (2) test the predictions of cosmological simulations for WHIM redshift evolution; (3) probe the distribution of IGM metals; (4) compare the metallicities with the large-scale distribution of galaxies.  We propose to observe 6 high-declination AGN to probe OVI, CIII, and HI absorbers. Danforth & Shull (2005) estimated that 5--10 OVI-bearing gas, and they estimated the metallicity at sim0.1 solar.  Previous OVI surveys are highly incomplete in these weak absorbers W_lambda < 80mAA) that contain a significant fraction of WHIM baryons. We will also measure HI Lyman beta and CIII lambda 977 to improve the multi-phase baryon census at z < 0.15.  FUSE and HST archival OVI data will be compared to test simulation predictions that the WHIM mass fraction increases at lower redshifts.  Galaxy redshift surveys will allow us to study the connections between OVI absorbers and the large-scale filamentary structure of galaxies, complete down to approx 0.2L^* at low redshifts, z < 0.15.  We will use the combined absorber and galaxy data to estimate the extent of metal dissemination in the IGM.  
G048|7| | |Dupree|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|Young stars can not only undergo accretion but also drive fast hot winds.  The winds revealed by FUSE spectra in 2 T Tauri stars (TW Hya and T Tau) viewed pole-on can affect the evolution of angular momentum in a system, define the geometry of the stellar magnetic field, cause ablation of a surrounding accretion disk, and serve as an acceleration site for optical jets.  We propose to determine the configuration and characteristics of the fast wind with FUSE spectra of 2 edge-on T Tauri stars in the nearby Eta Cha cluster (RECX-11 and ECHA J0843.3-7905) that are well-matched in age to TW Hya. If the outflow is collimated from the stellar polar region, the shape of the O VI and C III lines in high inclination systems should differ markedly from those in systems viewed pole-on.  Additionally, signatures of H_2 can indicate its presence (or not) in the circumstellar environment.
G050|7| | |Howk|University of Notre Dame|Galaxies are known to interact with each other.  These interactions can have profound effects on the gaseous components of galaxies, often by inducing star formation or stripping material from the main bodies of the interacting systems.  Thus, these interactions have a significant connection to the manner in which galaxies evolve with time and pollute the intergalactic medium with non-primordial material.  The Magellanic Bridge, gas that links the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC, LMC), is believed to result from a recent close encounter between the SMC and LMC.  The Bridge provides an unique opportunity to study tidally-stripped, star-forming gas inasmuch as its proximity to our own Galaxy and the absence of sight line confusion with material from the Milky Way allow us to study it using UV absorption lines.  We propose to obtain new FUSE spectra of ESO31-8, a Seyfert galaxy situated behind the Bridge near the SMC, and DGIK975, a B2V star within the Bridge near the LMC.  Our observations will provide absolute interstellar Magellanic Bridge abundances.  These abundances will be compared to those of the SMC and LMC to determine the origins of the Bridge and the source of its chemical enrichment. We will study and compare the kinematics and column densities of FUV absorptions such as OVI, CIII, SIII, FeIII, PII, SiII, FeII, ArI, and H_2, between several lines of sight within the Bridge and with sightlines within the Clouds to further understand the interaction and evolution of the Magellanic system.
G052|7| | |Sankrit|Johns Hopkins University|We propose observations of OVI emission from conductive interfaces in the local interstellar medium.  These interfaces have been identified by their OVI absorption lines in the spectra of nearby white dwarfs.  The OVI column densities in the interfaces have been measured.  We will target regions at small angular separations from the white dwarfs to ensure that the emission and absorption sample the same gas.  The target sight lines were chosen to have high background interstellar extinction, so the probability of contamination by emission from regions further away is minimized.  The combination of emission and absorption data for OVI will allow us to obtain the densities of the emitting regions, and the path length through them.  This detailed characterization of the interfaces between hot and warmcool gas will allow a greater understanding of the physical processes at work in creating and maintaining them.  Our understanding of OVI production in the local interstellar medium can then be applied to the general case, since such interfaces are likely to be ubiquitous in the Galaxy and beyond.
G053|7| | |Danforth|University of Colorado|Superbubbles are a major mechanism of feedback between massive stars and the ISM and are thought to be the primary means through which coronal gas flows from the disk into the halo.  Many are seen to be bright in soft X-rays and photoionized optical emission.  Between these two phases should exist a warm-hot (T  10^5 K) component formed either through shock heating or thermal conduction.  OVI lambda lambda 032,1037 is an ideal tracer of this warm-hot gas as it is not formed through photoionization in the ISM.  However, absorption from the diffuse OVI in the LMC halo tends to overwhelm any absorption seen within a superbubble.  We have observed four sight lines toward LMC superbubble N70 and see an excess of OVI absorption in comparison to four nearby, field sight lines.  We interpret this excess OVI absorption, which amounts to log N_OVI14.05 or approx 60 percent greater than is seen in the comparison sight lines, as the signature of hot gas within N70, however, it is possible that this reflects normal variation in the halo of the LMC.  A detection of OVI in emission from N70 would seal the case for a warm-hot component in superbubbles.  Emission and absorption data together will constrain physical density and the mechanism through which OVI is produced in superbubbles.  We propose to place two LWRS apertures on N70 and attempt to measure diffuse OVI and CIII emission from the superbubble.
G058|7| | |Espey|Trinity College Belfast|For the majority of red giant stars the basic mass-loss processes at work are unknown. Indeed, for stars of spectral types between K0 III and M5-M6 III, much remains unknown about the regions above the visible photosphere and the transportation of the processed material outwards to the ISM. Theories and models are in need of observational constraint, and in particular it is vital to derive spatially resolved information throughout the wind acceleration region within a few giant radii of the stars photosphere. Eclipsing symbiotic binary systems, consisting of an evolved giant in orbit with a white dwarf, provide an opportunity to take advantage of the finite size of the hot component to probe different levels of the chromosphere and wind acceleration region in absorption. This provides spatially resolved thermal, ionisation and dynamic information on the wind which can then be compared against predictions of hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere codes. We propose 6 observations of the symbiotic SY Mus utilizing the 0 day periodicity inherent in FUSE scheduling to phase space the observations.  Results will be compared to PHOENIX hydrodynamical models and to similar observations of earlier spectral type symbiotic giants to constrain wind acceleration and chromospheric models.
G060|7| | |Guinan|Villanova University|We propose to extend and expand our ongoing Sun in Time Program on solarstellar dynamo physics and X-rayFUV irradiance (and effects on planetary atmospheres) of solar-type (G0-5 V) stars to cooler, more numerous dM stars with deep convective zones (CZs). This proposal is also motivated by the upcoming exoplanetary search missions e.g. Kepler, SIM, and DarwinTPF) that will search for earth-like planets in the habitable zones of nearby G-K-M stars.  Two years ago the program was extended to include FUSE Cycle 5 observations of a sample of dK0-5 stars of different ages. Here we propose a 40 ksec FUSE observation of a carefully selected representative old disk dM star -- SZ UMa -- which will help complete the parameter space of age, rotation, and FUV emission for dM stars. Also, we wish to explore the effect of the CZ depth on magnetic activity by comparing dwarf G, K, and M stars with similar rotation periods and ages. Of particular interest is the determination of X-rayFUV emission flux evolution with age for dM stars. This is because of the critical roles that FUV TR and chromospheric emissions (dominated by HI Lyman series and CIII and OVI emissions) play on the photochemical and photoionization evolution (and possible erosion) of planetary atmospheres and ionospheres. This program will also have a major impact on studies of FUV radiation and its effects on the environments of extrasolar planets that may be hosted by dM stars and on the possible origin and evolution of extraterrestrial life on such planets. We plan to combine the FUSE FUV observations with X-ray and UV (from IUE or HST, where available) to form spectral irradiance tables (flux at 1 AU) of dM stars covering a wide range of ages. With FUSE nearing the end of its usable lifetime, this may be the last chance to complete this important FUV dataset.
G061|7| | |Chayer|Johns Hopkins University|We propose FUSE observations of a sample of hot subdwarf B stars (sdB) in order to carry out an abundance analysis of heavy elements and see how their abundance patterns emerge from the observations.  It is a well known fact that the atmospheres of these extreme horizontal branch stars exhibit abundance anomalies.  Diffusion processes such as gravitational settling, radiative levitation, weak stellar winds, and accretion have been proposed to explain the abundance anomalies.  Our goal is to identify which mechanisms operate in the atmospheres of these stars, study their interactions, understand the abundance patterns, and ultimately, constrain the structure of the atmospheres of sdB stars.  With this proposal we want to complete our FUSE proposals E152 and F909 with targets that are feasible with the new FUSE.  Only four sdB stars out of forty have been already observed within these two programs, and only three more targets are still feasible.  This is why we propose observations of a new sample of sdB stars that can be done with the new FUSE.  To study and interpret the abundance patterns in sdB stars, we need a large sample of stars with atmospheric parameters that cover the whole effective temperature and gravity domains (20,000 K < T_eff < 40,000 K ; 5.0 < log g < 6.5).  To achieve a thorough abundance analysis we need FUSE observations, because many resonance lines of elements such as phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, iron peak elements, and elements beyond the iron group are only visible in the FUV range for the effective temperatures of interest.  This study will not only provide new insights into the stellar atmosphere structure of sdB stars, but also to the evolution of galaxies since these stars are the most important candidates for the source of the UV excess in elliptical galaxies and early-type spiral bulges.
G062|7| | |Wesemael|Universite de Montreal|The DB white dwarfs belong to the subgroup of white dwarf stars which possess an atmosphere dominated by helium. Their optical spectra are characterized by the transitions of neutral helium, and their effective temperatures range from 30,000 K to approximately 13,000 K. Trace elements are also occasionally seen in the atmosphere, principally hydrogen, but also a handful of heavy elements like carbon and silicon.  To explain the abundance patterns of both dominant and trace elements, several processes must be called upon, namely upward diffusion of hydrogen left over from previous evolutionary phases, downward settling of heavy elements, convective dredge-up from deeper layers, convective mixing, accretion from the ISM, radiative element support, stellar winds etc. Our picture of the abundance patterns of trace elements remains sketchy, however, especially for the cooler DB stars. We propose to secure spectra for three DB stars spanning the effective temperature range between 14,400 and 17,900 K with the specific aims of obtaining abundances of several elements (principally C, but also Si, N, Fe) and of testing the reliability of our model atmospheres in that wavelength range. The FUSE observations will provide us with a unique opportunity to study the competing physical processes which affect the photospheric abundance of heavy elements in DB stars.
G063|7| | |Penny|College of Charleston|Recent theoretical predictions for low metallicity massive stars predict that these stars should have drastically reduced equatorial winds (mass loss) while on the main sequence, and as such should retain most of their angular momentum.  Observations of both the Be(B+Be) ratio and the blue-to-red supergiant ratio appear to have a metallicity dependence that may be caused by high rotational velocities.  But to date only two studies of the rotation rates of massive stars have been completed.  Their results differ, one finding that lower Z massive stars do rotate faster, one finding the opposite.  In addition both studies have limitations.  The first observed only stars with masses lower than 12 M_sun, which are not predicted by theory to have rotation rates affected by metallicity.  The second had only a small sample, and one which may have been skewed to narrow-lined targets.  The Multimission Archive at Space Telescope MAST) contains FUSE archival spectra of over 140 O-type stars in the Magellanic Clouds.  This is a significantly large sample that can be used to address this question with directly measured projected rotational velocities in a low metallicity environment.  The method to employ is that used in previous studies on both IUE and STISHST spectra (Penny 1996, Howarth et al. 1997, Penny et al. 2004).  An UV spectrum of a test star is cross-correlated with a narrow-lined star to create a cross-correlation function (CCF).  The width of this CCF is related to the intrinsic width of the spectral lines of the star.  To determine projected rotational velocities, an accurate calibration must be found between CCF widths and V sin i values, for a sample of stars for which these values are already known.  Archival FUSE spectra also exist for over 100 Galactic O-type stars with known projected rotational velocities.  However there is a paucity of narrow-lined targets from the Galaxy available.  This severely limits the calibration of CCF width to V sin i and results in overestimates of the latter from FUSE spectra.  The acquisition of five additional narrow-lined stellar spectra will complete the calibration of CCF width to V sin i.  And allow the huge archive of LMC and SMC O-type spectra to be used to its fullest potential.
G067|7| | |Ghavamian|Johns Hopkins University|We propose FUSE observations of a large shell associated with the ultraluminous X-ray source Holmberg IX X-1 (a.k.a. M81 X-9).  The optical spectrum of the shell shows a classic shock spectrum, with strong SII relative to H alpha. The X-ray emission derives primarily from an embedded ultraluminous (approx 10^40 ergs s^-1) X-ray source (ULX).  The source is pointlike and may be an accreting intermediate mass (100-1000 M_odot) black hole.  Its relationship to the nebular shell is poorly understood. The shell may be a supershell blown by multiple stellar winds and SNe, or it may be the remnant of a single highly energetic (E > 10^53 ergs) explosion (i.e., hypernova). Understanding the kinematics of the shell will provide a critical clue to the origin of the X-ray source Ho IX X-1.  We will search for CIII andor OVI and other FUV line emission from the shell and use the line ratios to constrain the shock speed.  As a bonus, we also plan to search for emission from the compact photoionization nebula around the ULX itself.  The measurement of OVI from this source would provide valuable information such as the absorbing column in the immediate vicinity of the compact object and the shape of the ionizing spectrum.  The Ho IX X-1 shell is likely the only ULX with low enough extinction to be observable in the FUV, and is well-matched to the diffuse source capabilities of FUSE.
G073|7| | |Dixon|Johns Hopkins University|We propose FUSE observations of the hot post-asymptotic giant branch PAGB) star BS in the globular cluster 47Tuc.  The star has been observed with the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) and from the ground, and we seek to answer questions raised by those observations.  Models fit to the stars FUV and optical spectra vastly over-predict the flux at wavelengths shorter than that of Lyman beta.  What is the source of this excess opacity  According to stellar evolution theory, stars that have undergone first dredge-up on the RGB should be enhanced in nitrogen and depleted in carbon.  Its HUT spectrum suggests that the star is overabundant in nitrogen and underabundant in carbon, but the lines of both elements are are blended with interstellar features at the HUT resolution.  By comparing the stars FUSE spectrum with synthetic spectra derived from stellar atmosphere models, we can determine the stars photospheric abundances and reconstruct the history of its chemical evolution and mass loss.
G076|7| | |Peters|University of Southern California|We propose a FUSE observation of the Be star B12 in NGC330 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to determine the abundances of carbon and nitrogen in its photosphere.  During the past two decades there has been a consensus that the rotation rates in Be stars are rapid but far short of their critical values (0.50 < VV_cr < 0.85). But recently there has been a renewed interest in the possibility that Be stars are critical rotators (Townsend, Owocki, & Howarth 2004).  Abundance studies can provide a test for the latter hypothesis, as stellar evolution modeling by Meynet & Maeder (2000) has predicted a significant enhancement in the photospheric N abundances in very rapidly rotating OB stars due to mixing of CNO-processed material from their interiors. The FUV is the best spectral region for determining CN abundances in Be stars as the strongest lines of CII, III and NII, III fall in this region and the flux contribution from the disk is not important. The Be star B12 in NGC330 is ideal for an abundance analysis as it has relatively sharp lines.  A recent abundance study from optical data (Lennon et al. 2005) suggested a low N abundance, but the result was inconclusive as it was based upon only one very weak line. The low N abundance in the SMC renders it an ideal environment in which to look for altered abundances due to rotational mixing.  We also propose an observation of a well-known, sharp-lined non-emission B star in NGC 330 (B30) in order to be able to compare the CN abundances in NGC330-B12 with benchmark values for the cluster.
G081|7| | |DeWarf|Villanova University|A long standing problem and a central topic of solar-stellar connection studies is that of relating the Suns magnetic behavior to other stars.  Our Sun is used as a fundamental calibration and as a reference point for stellar theory.  This requires that the Suns expressions of activity (distribution of magnetic active regions, coronal densities, emergence of magnetic flux, etc.) are fundamentally normal for a star of its age and evolutionary history.  Direct comparison with true solar analogs is critical for both understanding the magnetic nature of the Sun as well as magnetic phenomena in other stars.  alpha Cen is the nearest stellar system to our Sun.  The G2V primary (alpha Cen A) is an almost perfect solar analog with regard to its mass, radius, temperature, and convection zone depth, but is slightly older (tau approx 5-6 Gyr) than our Sun.  These properties are well determined through extensive studies, making it an ideal Sun-as-a-star comparison to test solar concepts.  Recently, X-ray emission fluxes for alpha Cen A were observed to diminish by a factor of nearly 25(), a phenomenon never before observed for the Sun of any solar-aged star.  The XMM observations imply that the chromospheric through coronal regions of alpha Cen A can be highly variable, with changes in both mean temperatures and, to a larger extent, the emission measures necessary to address these new observations.  The requested FUSE observations are crucial to a program to examine the long-term magnetic activity cycle of alpha Cen A.  We hope to observe alpha Cen A during Cycle 7 to obtain high quality FUV spectra during this unprecedented, very deep quiescent state of this up til now normal solar-type star.  These FUSE observations will be compared to the FUSE spectra secured in 2001 to search for differences in line strengthsprofiles along with carrying out detailed emission measure analysis.  We will coordinate these FUSE observations with the XMM observations of the target that are planned by a European group.
G701|7| | |Brown|University of Colorado|We propose a FUSE survey of stellar activity among the members of the Tucana-Horologium Association with dec < -50 deg, using the O VI and C III transition region emission lines as diagnostics of the transition region (10^5 K) activity. This set of stars is a 30 million year old subgrouping within the Local Association.  These spectra will significantly expand the sample of young active, zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS), F-M stars with measured transition region emission line fluxes, and allow direct comparision with the younger (12 Myr) beta Pic Moving Group stars, from our Cycle 6 FUSE Legacy program, and other older stars from the AB Dor (50 Myr) and Pleaides (100 Myr) Moving Groups. These spectra will allow detailed studies of the influence of stellar activity on the immediate circumstellar environment of young stars during the crucial phases of protoplanetary system formation, when the formation of gas giant planets and smaller terrestrial planets is underway. The sample chosen for this study have identical ages and formed together during the same star formation episode.  By studying such samples of low and intermediate mass stars with identical ages and formation history, a clearer determination of the factors controlling stellar magnetic activity can be obtained, thus enabling better characterization of the evolution in stellar activity during the crucial early phases of stellar, circumstellar disk, and protoplanetary system evolution.
G713|7| | |Thilker|Johns Hopkins University|GALEX has dramatically increased the number of galaxies in the local Universe for which sensitive, high-resolution UV imagery is available.  In particular, our Nearby Galaxies Survey (NGS), Medium Imaging Survey MIS), and Deep Imaging Survey (DIS) have together provided FUV and NUV imaging observations at approx 5 arcsec resolution for 200+ galaxies with v <2500 kms and delta > 50 deg.  In addition to establishing a benchmark for global UV galaxy morphology, these three core GALEX surveys have yielded an unprecedented sample of UV-bright stellar complexes which probe a diverse set of host environments.  FUSE offers a superb opportunity to obtain FUV spectra for these stellar nurseries (intermediate-luminosity starbursts).  As a class they harbor much of the star formation in normal galaxies, yet remain under-represented within the FUSE archive.  We propose survey observations for a sample of 24 such UV-bright complexes in 12 nearby galaxies. FUSE spectra will constrain the massive stellar content in each object.  We will further determine the equivalent width of NIV, CIII, and PV winds lines as a function of metallicity, setting up for their use as a high redshift metallicity indicator. The combination of FUSE, GALEX, and infrared (Spitzer, eventually JWST) observations of our sample will prove particularly powerful, delineating variations of the UV attenuation law versus environment.  We have already initiated such panchromatic work. In a parallel effort approved for FUSE Cycle 6 F918) and in a follow-up Cycle 7 proposal, we are investigating a small number of extranuclear star-forming regions highlighted by SINGS the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey) for which we have IRACMIPS imaging and 5-37 mu m spectroscopy to complement the UV observations.  Similar Spitzer imagery is available for 10 of 12 galaxies we focus on here. IR spectroscopy will be proposed, but FUSE and GALEX now present a chance which should not be missed.
G917|7| | |Crenshaw|Georgia State University|The most popular models for the intrinsic UV and X-ray absorption lines in AGN invoke accretion-disk winds that are driven outward by radiation pressure, magnetocentrifugal forces, andor thermal pressure. However, recent observational evidence suggests that most of the UV absorption in Seyfert galaxies arises from much further out than predicted by these models, at distances of tens of parsecs (in the inner narrow-line region). Is there any evidence for absorption close to the nucleus, providing at least indirect evidence for accretion-disk winds NGC 3516, with high-column UV and X-ray absorbers at distances less than 0.2 pc from its active nucleus, is a prime candidate for detecting accretion-disk outflows, possibly due to a special viewing angle with respect to its accretion-disk axis. We propose new FUSE observations of NGC 3516 over a range of time scales days to months) much smaller than previously obtained (years) to pin down the distances, dynamics, and physical conditions of its UV absorbers, and thereby test the accretion-disk wind scenario. NGC 3516 provides multiple opportunities to obtain four 20 ksec CVZ observations over a range of time scales during Cycle 7.
G921|7| | |Dupuis|Canadian Space Agency|We are re-proposing a survey program of DA white dwarfs approved for cycle 6 with a list of targets more suited for the new pointing constraints caused by the loss of an additional reaction wheel on FUSE. This survey concentrates mainly on stars cooler than 20,000K but a couple of slightly hotter stars were included for increased flexibility of FUSE scheduling.  Cooler DA white dwarfs have not been studied as extensively than hotter white dwarfs by FUSE as they tend to be fainter and are not good background sources for deuterium studies. We will search for the presence of trace elements such as C, N, Si, and Fe in the atmosphere of these cooler white dwarfs. Previous observations of white dwarfs in this temperature range have revealed surprisingly high metallicity in a subset of these stars. This is in spite of the dwindling of support by selective radiative acceleration at these temperatures. The current wisdom about this phenomenon is that these stars are accreting matter, either interstellar or circumstellar, which then pollutes their atmospheres. These observations will allow us to potentially discover new cool metal-enriched DAs and further our understanding of this peculiar phenomenon. These observations will also allow us to improve our understanding of quasi-molecular satellites which become prominent in the wings of Lyman beta and Lyman gamma profiles at these temperatures.
G923|7| | |Peters|University of Southern California|Following the recent FUSE detection of a well-defined accretion hot spot in the Algol binary UCephei (P2fd493), an active system in which the gas stream strikes the mass gainers photosphere at a steep angle, we propose new observations to determine physical and geometrical parameters for the impact site and its apparently associated splash plasma. The capabilities of FUSE present us with an unparalleled opportunity to map a splash plasma in velocity and physical space, as many prominent shell-type absorption features are formed in this gas. Furthermore, the location, size, and temperature of the impact site can be well-determined because the flux contrast between the spot and the photosphere of the B7-8 mass gainer is large in the FUV.  We propose a series of randomly spaced observations, each with a duration of 5 orbits (approx 10 ksec of observing time) and spanning a phase interval of 0.13 in the 60 hr period. Statistically half of the observations should fall in important phase interval .63-0.13 that includes totality and the transit of the hot spot through our line of sight. Based upon the results from previous FUSE observations of Algol binaries during total eclipse (Peters & Polidan 004) we expect that the stream impact produces a high-temperature circumstellar plasma abovebelow the orbital plane that emits in OVI. Totality observations of UCep would allow us to test a hypothesis that this bipolar flow is a result of an impact-produced splash of material.  To increase the chance of observing the 2.3hr total eclipse that will enable us to map the location of the expected high-temperature plasma, we request 10 visits.  The physical parameters that are obtained from the observations will constrain future 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of mass flow in Algols and enable an estimate of the amount of mass lost from the system during the Algol phase of evolution.
G924|7| | |Peters|University of Southern California|We propose a survey of Be stars that reside in galactic clusters to determine the abundances of carbon and nitrogen in their photospheres.  During the past two decades there has been a consensus that the rotation rates in Be stars are rapid but far short of their critical values (0.50 < VV_cr < 0.85). But recently there has been a renewed interest in the possibility that Be stars are critical rotators Townsend, Owocki, & Howarth 2004).  Abundance studies can provide a test for the latter hypothesis, as stellar evolution modeling by Meynet & Maeder (2000) has predicted a significant enhancement in the photospheric N abundances in very rapidly rotating OB stars due to mixing of CNO-processed material from their interiors. The FUV is the best spectral region for determining CN abundances in Be stars as the strongest lines of CII, III and NII, III fall in this region and the flux contribution from the disk is not important.  The survey will include Be stars in h & ChiPer, a galactic cluster that contains a large fraction of Be stars, NGC 3766, and NGC 4755, and provide an independent test of the critical rotation hypothesis and contemporary stellar evolution models that include stellar rotation.
G925|7| | |Godon|Villanova University|The white dwarfs (WDs) in cataclysmic variables (CVs) are probes of cataclysmic evolution and accretion physics because they bear the thermal, chemical and rotational imprint of their long term accretion and thermonuclear history. An understanding of the consequences of accretion in CVs is the first step in a global understanding of accretion-related phenomena throughout the universe including Young Stellar Objects, galactic binaries (accretion onto neutron stars and black holes) and AGN, which cant be easily observed.  We propose a FUSE survey of 16 dwarf nova (DN) systems (a class of CVs in which the WD can easily be observed) for which FUV spectra in quiescence have never been obtained before.  These systems have not been studied in detail (only five have a known period) and little is known about their accreting WD. We propose to determine the WD surface temperature, gravity, rotation rate and composition and probe their innermost disk accretion flows (e.g. detect and characterize accretion belts) by applying multi-component synthetic spectral analyses to the FUSE data. We will use photometry to look for periodic signals in the FUSE time tag data and determine the orbital period of those systems for which it is unknown.
G927|7| | |Iping|Catholic University of America|We propose a FUV survey of evolved massive stars in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC.  The targets include Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) and late-type Wolf-Rayet (W-R) stars.  LBVs, a transition stage between O and W-R stars, are in the early stages of post-main sequence evolution. They undergo brief, high mass-loss-rate episodes that bring processed material from deep within the stars to the surface.  The far-UV spectra will be used to determine stellar wind mass-loss rates and terminal velocities at different metallicities.  The role of rotation, asphericity and clumping in the wind will also be investigated.  Spectral features tracing a range of wind ionization states will be modelled with the latest version of the non-LTE, line blanketed, geometrically extended, expanding atmosphere code CMFGEN.  The FUSE spectral range is ideally suited to test these models and determine metallicity effects connected with the complex mass loss from LBVs and W-R stars.
G931|7| | |Blair|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to continue an unbiased ultraviolet survey of supernova remnants in both Magellanic Clouds that was begun in FUSE Cycles 4 and .  In these earlier programs, we have successfully detected at least 5 Magellanic remnants, 14 of which had no previous FUV observations.  This work indicates that optical andor X-ray characteristics of supernova remnants are not always good predictors of the objects that will be bright and detectable in the UV.  This survey proposal will add to this unique database by obtaining spectra of additional Magellanic Cloud remnants with a range of radio, optical, and X-ray properties.  A standard request of 10 ks per object using the LWRS aperture is used for the survey, reaching a limiting flux in OVI lambda 1032 about a factor of 100 below the flux observed for the bright LMC remnant N49.  In this proposal, we request time to observe any or all of the previously proposed targets that have not yet been observed (10 SMC objects plus 1 LMC object), and 11 new LMC remnants identified only recently as part of the MCELS project.  As a survey program, the time and number of targets listed is effectively an upper limit to the actual request.
G932|7| | |Friedman|Space Telescope Science Institute|The existence of small scale structures in the interstellar medium ISM) has now been verified using a variety of techniques, including optical, radio, and ultraviolet instruments.  They have been observed on scales ranging from tens of AU to parsecs.  One of the best ways to probe the smallest scales is with multi-epoch observations, in which one discerns spectral changes arising from material between an observer and a background source.  The number of such observations in dominant species in the ISM, as revealed by absorption line studies in the ultraviolet, is very small.  In addition, the physics of these structures, including their confinement mechanisms, lifetimes, pressures, and composition, is not well-understood.  We propose a survey program to re-observe 18 stars already observed with FUSE more than 3 years earlier to search for time dependent changes in their spectra.  We will do profile fitting, curve-of-growth, and apparent optical depth analyses to search for changes in H2 and a variety of other species, such as CI, FeII, PII, ClI, and ClII.  These will allow estimates of electron temperatures, volume densities, and depletions.  The stars were selected on the basis of early spectral type, and existing high SN FUSE spectra obtained in TTAG mode, which will allow the best opportunity to detect subtle changes in the spectral features.  The newly obtained data will be useful for a variety of investigations beyond those described here, by providing a dataset of multi-epoch, high SN spectra of early-type stars.
G933|7| | |Hebrard|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|Deuterium abundance measurements allow constraints to be put on the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the baryonic content of the Universe, and the chemical evolution of galaxies. Such measurements in a variety of astrophysical environments was one of the main justifications for FUSE.  This program is dedicated to the interstellar deuterium abundance, representative of the Present Epoch, noted DH_PE.  The first FUSE results show that DH_ISM likely has a single value in the Local Bubble, near 1.5times10^-5.  Beyond 100pc, however, analyses of more than 10 sight lines show a range of DH values that disagree with the local value. Two interpretations are proposed.  One assumes deuterium is depleted onto dust grains and finds DH_PE above 2times10^  -5 . The second emphasizes the DO measurements and finds dshpe below 1times10^:  -5 .  Both would challenge models of deuterium evolution.  Definitive conclusions are prevented by the limited number of measurements. We propose here to increase the sample of deuterium measurements along distant sight lines. Subdwarfs are targets that are especially well adapted for this purpose.  This survey program will allow deuterium abundances to be measured toward new distant sight lines, as well as extra candidates for deuterium measurements outside the Local Bubble to be selected for future observations.
G936|7| | |Gruendl|University of Illinois|The Carina Nebula is the nearest example of a starburst region.  At a distance of approx 2 kpc, its stellar content and interstellar structure can be resolved and studied in detail. The mechanical energies injected by massive stars have yielded a large amount of hot, X-ray-emitting gas in the Carina Nebula. Optical and X-ray observations reveal a complex relationship between 10^4 K and 10^6 K gas components.  We request FUSE observations of the Carina Nebula to use emission lines to study both the physical conditions and kinematic properties of the hot gas in X-ray-emitting regions. In particular, we will use the OVI emission lines, in conjunction with complementary X-ray and optical data, to study SNR shocks and interfaces between hot >10^6 K) gas and the surrounding cooler (10^4 K) shell gas. The results will aid in our understanding of the generation and conditions of hot gas in distant, unresolved starburst regions.
G938|7| | |Sankrit|Johns Hopkins University|We propose a survey of OVI emission along sight lines at small angular separation from nearby white dwarfs that have been observed by FUSE.  The white dwarf spectra present a wide range of OVI absorption properties, ranging from no detectable OVI to circumstellar OVI.  The results of our survey will allow us to characterize the relationship between emission and absorption along closely spaced sight-lines.  In a companion (standard) proposal we have requested observations of the four best cases of emissionabsorption pairs of sight-lines.  Those results will be used to obtain the physical properties of conductive interfaces in the local interstellar medium, which in turn will help us interpret the data obtained in this survey.
H015|8| | |Brown|University of Colorado|The young (7 Myr), nearby (97 pc), sparse eta Cha cluster provides a very special opportunity to understand the processes controlling protoplanetary system evolution. Within this cluster 40 low mass stars retain primordial disks and are still accreting, while the more massive stars have dissipated their inner disks. The most massive member now has a debris disk that indicates advanced protoplanetary system development. We propose FUSE observations of the most active, unobserved, low mass members of the cluster and the remaining unobserved intermediate mass member. This will provide an improved quantification of the evolution of stellar activity at this particularly critical and poorly sampled evolutionary phase, and give a better picture of the conditions under which this interesting set of primordial disks, potential disks with inner holes, and debris disks are undergoing the process of planetary system formation.
H017|8| | |Ignace|East Tennessee State Univ.|The role of rotation for the mass loss from massive stars, with relevance for their evolution, is an important topic for which a number of outstanding questions persist. Chief among the puzzles is the creation and maintenance of disks and bipolar winds observed around some evolved massive stars -- the supergiant Be (sgBe) stars and Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs). We are seeking FUSE time to observe 4 stars of these types in the Magellanic Clouds. The goal will be to analyze the wind lines to further our understanding of the wind structure, to restrict the inclination of the systems, and possibly to derive the rotation velocity of the central stars. We expect to probe the faster polar wind with higher ionization lines (e.g., Nsc iii, Csc iii) and, potentially probe the equatorial or disk flow with lower ions (e.g., Sisc ii, Nsc ii, Fesc ii).
H023|8| | |Bianchi|Johns Hopkins University|We analysed FUSE, HSTIUE and optical spectra of O-type stars in the Milky Way and found T_eff and luminosities significantly lower (approx 10 to 20 than previous determinations for our sample stars, and than values assigned to their spectral types from previous compilations. This result has relevant implications for our understanding of massive stars evolution, and of the energy balance of HII regions. Although modeling of optical lines with line-blanketed atmospheres also indicates lower effective temperatures than classical calibrations, the hitherto still quantitatively discrepant (between optical and UV diagnostics) results on Teff and especially mass loss rates could be reconciled with a revised inclusion of X-rays from shocks and clumping in the wind modeling. These effects can only be constrained by lines in the FUSE range e.g. Bianchi, Herald, and Garcia 2006). Such analysis for a representative number of stars covering the early spectral types will ultimately provide a refined calibration of the temperature scale  versus spectral type and luminosity class, as well as other important parameters such as mass loss rate. We propose to observe a final sample of four Milky Way stars, to remedy remaining gaps in the coverage of early spectral types in the list of FUSE observed or approved Galactic stars. By contrast, a very good coverage of spectral types for Magellanic Cloud stars is already available in the FUSE archive. A similar sampling of the early spectral types in the Milky Way will provide a unique opportunity to compare massive stars parameters among the three galaxies with very different metallicities (MW, LMC, SMC). The data will have additional value as an archival resource for population synthesis work, and ISM studies.
H025|8| | |Dixon|Johns Hopkins University|We propose fuse observations of three extended horizontal-branch (EHB) stars spectral type sdB) in the globular cluster NGC6752 to determine their photospheric abundances. With effective temperatures ranging from 20,000 K to 35,000 K and surface gravities ranging from log g 5.0 to 6.2, EHB stars occupy the high-temperature extension of the normal horizontal branch; their hydrogen envelopes are too thin to trigger nuclear fusion of hydrogen. The atmospheres of field EHB stars are chemically peculiar and show unusual and puzzling abundance patterns. Diffusion processes such as gravitational settling, radiative levitation, and possibly weak stellar winds are believed to be responsible for the abundance anomalies. Our goal is to compare EHB stars in NGC 6752 with theoretical models to identify the mechanisms at work in the atmospheres of these stars, to understand their abundance patterns, and ultimately, to constrain their atmospheric structure. Because EHB stars and their progeny may contribute significantly to the UV excess seen in elliptical galaxies, an understanding of their abundances, opacities, and resulting EUV and FUV spectra is important for studies of both galactic evolution and the intergalactic medium.
H036|8| | |Wesemael|Universite de Montreal|The DB white dwarfs belong to the subgroup of white dwarf stars which possess an atmosphere dominated by helium. Their optical spectra are characterized by the transitions of neutral helium, and their effective temperatures range from 30,000 K to approximately 13,000 K. Trace elements are also occasionally seen in the atmosphere, principally hydrogen, but also a handful of heavy elements like carbon and silicon. To explain the abundance patterns of both dominant and trace elements, several processes must be called upon, namely upward diffusion of hydrogen left over from previous evolutionary phases, downward settling of heavy elements, convective dredge-up from deeper layers, convective mixing, accretion from the ISM, radiative element support, and stellar winds. Because the abundances of heavy elements have been determined in so few DB stars, our picture of the abundance trends remains sketchy and the potential to test theoretical models remains largely unfulfilled. We thus propose to secure spectra for four DB stars spanning the effective temperature range between 16,000 and 3,000 K with the specific aims of obtaining abundances of several elements (principally C and Si, but also N, Fe, P, and S) and of testing the reliability of our model atmospheres in that wavelength range. The FUSE observations will provide us with a unique opportunity to study the competing physical processes which affect the photospheric abundance of heavy elements in DB stars.
H039|8| | |Andersson|Johns Hopkins University|Sophisticated nucleosynthesis models exploring the infall of low-metallicity high-velocity clouds on the chemical evolution of the host galaxy can account for the observed NO variations in metal-poor and metal-rich external galaxies. Subtle variations of the interstellar O: small I abundance in the Solar neighborhood suggest that infall of low-metallicity gas may have occurred within the Solar neighborhood. Precise observations of the NO abundance ratio are essential to test this hypothesis. Recent FUSE measurements of NH_: tot reveal variations with N(H_ tot ), but with significant scatter due to observational uncertainties. Here, we propose to obtain additional high SN observations of the weak interstellar N: small I doublet at 1160 AA in order to derive accurate nitrogen abundances and provide a direct comparison with the existing data. All stars in our sample have high-precision STIS:  HST measurements of the weak O small I 1356 AA line for a variety of stellar distances (0.2 leq d leq 3.5 kpc) from the Sun. This proposal is designed to investigate an intriguing trend with distance detected in the best published NO data available. If verified, these NO variations provide direct evidence for different nucleosynthetic histories within and around the Solar neighborhood. 
H045|8| | |Wisniewski|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|Massive OB stars are among the most dominant influences on the regions of the galaxies in which they live. Consequently, the understanding of their evolutionary paths is crucial to many aspects of astronomy. Be supergiants represent one of the post-main-sequence evolutionary phases of OB stars, yet they are one of the least well understood. We propose to triple the number of SMC Be supergiants observed to date by FUSE and complete the FUSE survey of all bright LMC Be supergiants. We will model these FUV data, along with ancillary optical spectra, UV spectra, and optical polarimetry, to probe the temperature, density, velocity structure, and geometry of Be disks. These fundamental disk parameters will be compared to predictions from the two leading models which seek to explain the mechanism responsible for the creation of Be disks. Additionally, we will probe the role metallicity may play in the formation and evolution of the Be phenomenon.
H058|8| | |McCandliss|Johns Hopkins University|The goal of this proposal is to quantify the star-forming galaxy contribution to the ionization history of the universe. We propose to build on the recent successes in finding Lyman continuum (Lyc) leakage from three blue compact galaxies (BCG) with FUSE, showing estimated leakage of between 4 -- 35 Leitet et al. (2006). We have developed a pool of nineteen far-UV bright candidate objects spanning a variety of starburst morphological types -- spirals, irregulars (Irr), BCG, mergers and interacting galaxies (IG) -- in the redshift range 0.017 le z le 0.043. For these nineteen objects we will be able to detect or limit the escape fraction of lyman continuum photons from star forming galaxies at the 5 detection threshold. By characterizing f_esc at low redshift across a wide spectrum of galaxy types, we obtain data that can be used to constrain the fraction of ionizing radiation originating in starburst galaxies during, and after, the era of reionization of the universe. This parameter is of great importance for understanding the formation of structure in the early universe. At present, direct spectroscopic measurements of Lyc leak in specific galaxy types at low redshift can only be made by FUSE.
H066|8| | |Dupree|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|FUSE spectra of 2 accreting T Tauri stars reveal similar asymmetric profiles of O VI 1032AA indicative of fast winds. Since one star is observed pole-on and the other observed at high inclination, this important result indicates that the winds are not highly collimated from the pole but originate from the whole Cha and EO Cha, are needed (a) to test whether the O VI emission flux results from accretion, or from the enhanced magnetic activity in a young star, (b) to determine whether massive winds vanish in young stars, once the accretion stops, thus giving credence to an accretion-driven wind in the classical T Tauri stage, and (c) to assess the presence of mass loss in the young Sun. The Category B targets, also in the Eta Cha association, will determine O VI emission and wind characteristics of an extreme accretor and a transition object experiencing disk clearing. 
H070|8| | |Iping|Catholic University of America|We propose to observe sna to measure the O VI flux from the shock interaction zones produced by the collision of high-velocity supernova ejecta with the dense inner circumstellar ring. Since the shock interaction with the inner ring began in 1997, broad (FWHMsim300 kms) emission from optical coronal lines (e.g. Fe X, Fe XI, and Fe XIV) has emerged and increased exponentially in strength. O VI 1032-1038 emission is expected to track the coronal lines. O VI is also expected to be the primary cooling transition for the million-degree shocked gas. A measure of the O VI line strength will significantly improve current models of the shock interaction. Earlier attempts to detect broad O VI from sna were inconclusive due to spectral contamination from two early-type stars within a few arc seconds of the SN. The proposed observation will use the narrowest FUSE slit (HIRS) to significantly reduce this effect.
H074|8| | |Smith|UC Santa Cruz|The aim of this proposal is to address a specific question concerning the incidence of winds among giant stars Do outflows in the transition region TR) occur among Luminosity Class II (LC II) bright giants of spectral types late-F through early-K The incidence of winds in such stars is significant for a number of reasons : i) LC II stars in this range of spectral type fall just faintward of a region in the H-R diagram within which circumstellar ionCa2 is detected. As such they may be in states of mass loss prior to, or in lieu of, the development of a cool wind. ii) Their chromospheric ion: Mg 2 emission profiles often show no evidence of outflow, thus if winds are present they must accelerate with altitude. iii) They may be relevant to the mechanism by which Population II red giants, which have --2.7 < Mv < --1.7 and similar effective temperatures, lose mass prior to becoming horizontal branch stars. High-altitude TR emission lines are well suited to test for accelerating winds. FUSE covers the key O 6 lambda1032 line that arises from altitudes where temperatures are sim 3 times 10^5 K, which is hotter than for TR lines typically observed by IUE and HST. Dupree et al. (2005) found evidence for wind opacity in the lambda1032 ionO6 line among a small sample of evolved giants observed with FUSE, but this only includes one LC II star, the relatively active binary beta Dra (B-V 1.0). We propose to analyze the O 6 lambda1032 and ion C 3 lambda977 line profiles for two single LC II giants of color B-V 0.8 and 1.2 in order to test more generally for the incidence of hot outflows among such stars.
H076|8| | |Bregman|University of Michigan|The tremendous amount of star formation in starburst galaxies gives rise to supernovae, hot gas, and superwinds. So it is no surprise that absorption by the OVI is seen in these systems, but we are stunned by the detection of even stronger OVI absorption in the bulge of M31, an extremely quiescent environment with little star formation. Not only is this line strong, is nearly black, which occurs only if the hot gas is optically thick and on the near side of the bulge. This absorbing gas, near 3E5 K, is either due to a bulge cooling flow or a galactic fountain-driven halo. We can determine if such hot halos are common around normal spirals, and distinguish between the two models through observations toward additional normal spiral bulges, as hardly any have been observed with FUSE. 
H079|8| | |Howk|University of Notre Dame|The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the closest gas-rich disk galaxy to our own Milky Way. It has been the focus of intense study by FUSE and other instruments in a quest to better understand feedback processes in such galaxies. The feedback of energy and matter from massive stars has created a gaseous halo about this galaxy, revealed by FUSE observations of ovi toward stars in the LMC. Toward the LMC, absorption from ovi and strong low-ionization lines can be found over a velocity range -50 la v_: LSR la +350 kms. Our recent analysis of FUSE and STIS observations of the LMC suggests that much of the material at v_: LSR ga +100 kms is actually associated with the LMC. If truly associated with the LMC, this material is moving away from its disk at velocities in excess of the escape velocity and potentially represents a galactic wind. We propose to study this putative LMC wind and the general ISM of the LMC by observing a Seyfert galaxy (CALF, aka RXJ0503.1-6634) that lies behind the optical disk of the LMC, allowing us to probe gas throughout the potential of the LMC. We will also observe a WR star within the LMC projected sim7arcmin (100 pc) from CALF. With these observations we will 1) study the total column density of warm and hot ionized gases in the LMC, determining if the background sight line probes a significantly increased column compared with the stellar sight line; 2) study the kinematics of the low, intermediate, and high ionization gas to search for evidence of a two-sided wind coming out of the LMC; and 3) compare the outflow structure and kinematics with observations of outflows from starburst and distant star forming galaxies. Our observations will provide a unique legacy for FUSE, providing the only measurements of an entire path through the LMC.
H083|8| | |Herczeg|California Institute of Technology|We propose to observe a range of CTTSs with FUSE to understand the structure of the accretion shock, estimate its contribution to disk photoevaporation, and analyze wind heating mechanisms. The ionO6 doublet, a unique tracer of 3times 10^5 K gas, will constrain the temperature structure of the shock. We can then use that temperature structure to indirectly infer the EUV emission from CTTSs, which may lead to substantial disk photoevaporation. H_2 absorption lines seen against O 6 emission will help to determine the hydrogen column density to the stars. The hydrogen column density measured from FUV spectra can then be compared with similar X-ray measurements, which appear to be discrepant for TW Hya. The strength of any ionN2 and ionFe3 wind absorption, relative to ionN1 and ionFe2, respectively, will determine whether the ionization equilibrium in the wind is controlled by photoionization or collisions.
H085|8| | |Paerels|Columbia University|Although most symbiotic stars produce only soft X-ray emission, hard X-ray emission greater than 50 keV has recently been detected with INTEGRAL and Swift from several exceptional symbiotic stars. These objects are members of a subclass of symbiotics characterized by rapid optical flickering. This flickering subclass may also contain high-mass white dwarfs (WDs) headed toward supernova Type Ia explosion. However, the basic underlying properties that make these these accreting WDs different from those in other symbiotics are not known. Very little observational data in the UV range exist for this new class of objects. Since the far-ultraviolet regime gives the best view of the hot WDs in symbiotic stars and their immediate environs, FUSE observations will help us determine the nature of these objects - i.e., whether the WDs are indeed massive, whether they are magnetic as is the case for hard X-ray emitting cataclysmic variables), whether they are jet-producing, or whether they have some other feature that distinguishes them from other symbiotic stars. We propose to perform FUSE observations of the hard X-ray symbiotics RT Cru, CD-573057, and CH Cyg. The properties of these hard X-ray symbiotics may hold the key to the signatures of magnetism in symbiotic stars, how the WDs in some symbiotics can grow to large masses, and the nature of jets and jet production in accreting WDs.
H087|8| | |Massa|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|We intend to address the issues of mass loss and clumping in OB star winds by observing a unique combination of resonance and excited state wind lines in 9 O9.5 -- B0 supergiants. The lines we propose to study are the Sisc ivlambdalambda 1393, 1400 resonance doublet (observed by iue and hst) and the sielambdalambda1122, 1128 excited state doublet, available only to fuse. What makes this pair unique is that sielambdalambda1128 is excited by Si: sc iv lambdalambda 400 (all other excited state wind lines are populated by resonance lines below 912AA). Stars in the very narrow spectral range we propose to observe have sie excited state lines that are clearly affected by a stellar wind situation allows us to test whether the excited state lines, and the assumptions used to predict their strengths, agree with the results obtained from the resonance lines. If so, then we can confidently use the excited state lines to infer mass loss rates in stars whose resonance lines are strongly saturated. In addition, we discuss how highly structured (clumped) winds can cause the ratio of the excited state to resonance line strengths to be larger than expected. Thus, if the two doublets yield consistent results, this provides an independent constraint on the nature of clumping in the winds of OB stars.
H088|8| | |Guinan|University of Villanova|The major aim of this proposal is to solve an important puzzle that we have recently uncovered in the examination of FUSE spectra of two nearby cepheids. This study will have a major impact on understanding the structure, heating, dynamics and possible magnetic activity of Cepheid (and related Hybrid Star) atmospheres. This program focuses primarily on 3 bright Cepheids -- Polaris (F7 Ib--II; 132.28-pc; P 3.98-d), beta Dor (F6 Ia; 349-pc; P 9.84-d) and delta Cep (F5 Iab; 273-pc; P 5.37-d). These cepheids are bright and located at high absolute declinations, thus having large amounts of available FUSE exposure times. Previous FUSE spectra of Polaris and beta Dor show the presence of strong C sc iii 977AA, 1176AA emission lines as well as the O sc vi 10321038AAemission doublet, indicating the presence of 50,000--300,000 K plasma in their extended atmospheres. Surprisingly, the four spectra of beta Dor available from the FUSE archive show significant variations in the C sc iii and O sc vi emission lines that appear to be correlated with pulsation. Unfortunately, only one Polaris FUSE spectrum is currently available, and there are currently no observations of the Classical Cepheid prototype delta Cep. We propose a multi-visit program (4 visits -- Polaris; 3 visits -- beta Dor; 4 visits -- delta Cep; 18--20-ksec each) to secure FUSE spectra sampled over their respective pulations. We have extensive observational material on Polaris. Recently we observed Polaris with Chandra (PI Evans) and found Polaris to be a very soft X-ray source (log L_ x 28.8 ergsec with virtually no counts above 1 keV). More X-ray observations are planned to discern whether the X-rays originate from the Cepheid itself or a ^  th mag dF5 companion. FUSE is ideally suited for this study because the FUV contains important diagnostic lines uncontaminated by the F-stars strong UV continua. FUSE also provides crucial information on the emission line fluxes, line profiles, and possible Doppler shifts that can be used to discern wind-driven mechanisms from magnetic activity effects.
H096|8| | |DeWarf|University of Villanova|Since 1990 we have been engaged in the Sun in Time project -- a program of coordinated multiwavelength observations of solar-type stars. These stars have been selected as proxies for the Sun at stages throughout its main-sequence lifetime, and are single, main-sequence G0-G5 stars of ages from sim70 Myr (representing the ZAMS Sun), to stars of approximately solar age, like alpha Cen A, together with older solar analogs with ages up to sim8.5 Gyr. These stars all have similar physical properties mass, radius, temperature, and depth of convection zone), differing only in age, or equivalently, rotation period. Specifically, we use these stars to investigate the decline in the level of solar magnetic activity as the Sun spins down, and also changes in the activity cycle with age. An important component of this Sun in Time project is the investigation of magnetic activity cycles that occur within these solar proxies, and the changes in the high energy coronal and transition region emissions. Recently, X-ray emission fluxes for one of our program stars, alpha Cen A, was observed to diminish by a factor of sim25 in only two years time, a phenomenon never before observed for any solar-aged star. The XMM observations imply that the chromospheric through coronal regions of alpha Cen A can be highly variable, with changes in both mean temperatures and the emission measures necessary to address these recent observations. We propose here to observe alpha Cen three times during Cycle 8 to delineate the evolution of this unprecedented, very deep magnetic inactivity state of this solar-type star. These new observations will be compared to the previously existing Cycle 2 spectra secured before this dramatic magnetic drop began, and the recent Cycle 7 observations obtained shortly after its X-ray minimum. We find that in this short span of five years alpha Cen A has exhibited a significant drop of approximately 2.5-3times in the key FUV emissions, which may indicate an activity cycle.
H098|8| | |Crowley|Trinity College Dublin|For the majority of red giant stars the basic mass-loss processes at work are unknown. Indeed, for stars of spectral types between K0 III and M5-M6 III, much remains unknown about the regions above the visible photosphere and the transportation of the processed material outwards to the ISM. Theories and models are in need of observational constraint, and in particular it is vital to resolved information throughout the wind acceleration region within a few giant radii of the stars photosphere. Eclipsing symbiotic binary systems, consisting of an evolved giant in orbit with a white dwarf, provide an opportunity to take advantage of the finite size of the hot component to probe different levels of the chromosphere and wind acceleration region in absorption. This provides spatially resolved thermal, ionization and dynamic information on the wind which can then be compared against predictions of hydrodynamical stellar atmosphere codes. We propose FUSE observations of 2 eclipsing symbiotic systems, utilizing the 60 day periodicity inherent in FUSE scheduling to phase space the observations. Results will be compared to PHOENIX wind models and also to a successful analysis of other eclipsing systems (EG And and BF Cyg with FUSE) with different binary and giant parameters, with a view towards constraining the wind acceleration and chromospheric models.
H901|8| | |Bianchi|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to observe with FUSE a representative, UV-selected sample of post-AGB objects with the goal of clarifying some important issues in the late stages of intermediate-mass star evolution, including the abundance of neon, which has broad implications for the born-again scenario and yield of chemical elements, and the fading of supersonic winds when the hot late-post-AGB stars enter the WD cooling sequence.  FUSE spectra, with corollary data at longer wavelengths, will uniquely enable precise determination of stellar parameters, especially Teff, mass loss (when present), and some abundances. FUSE spectra will also reveal possible circumstellar molecular hydrogen, yielding additional clues to the previous (red-giant) phases. Observations of binary systems will shed new light on evolutionary sequences predicted theoretically but which have previously been difficult to explore. The results are relevant in the context of stellar evolution but also of galaxy evolution, since these objects play a major role in the chemical enrichment of the ISM and their parent galaxy. The sample also includes sdB stars, which are thought to be the cause of the UV upturn in elliptical galaxies. The GALEX UV Sky Surveys provided the first unbiased and possibly complete census of such objects in the Milky Way (Bianchi et al. 2006a), that are elusive in optical surveys because of their high temperatures (to which optical colors are insensitive) and low optical luminosities. Targets for this proposal were chosen from our UV-selected catalogs (including WD, SD, PG1159 stars) to cover a range of physical parameters. In addition to our science goals, the sample will also augment the FUSE archive with new sight-lines for ISM studies.
H903|8| | |Godon|University of Villanova|The white dwarfs (WDs) and their accretion diskcolumn in cataclysmic variables (CVs) are probes of cataclysmic evolution and accretion physics, they bear the thermal, chemical and rotational imprint of their long term accretion and thermonuclear history. An understanding of the consequences of accretion in CVs is the first step in a global understanding of accretion-related phenomena throughout the universe including Young Stellar Objects, galactic binaries (accretion onto neutron stars and black holes) and AGN, which cant be easily observed. We propose a FUSE survey of 16 Nova-likes (NLs) systems (a sub-class of CVs) to characterize their hot component in the FUSE spectral range. These systems have not been studied in detail and little is known about their accreting WD : only approxhalf have a known period, only 3 have a STIS spectrum, and the classification of some is uncertain. We propose to determine the WD surface temperature, gravity, rotation rate and composition and probe their innermost disk accretion flowscolumn by applying multi-component synthetic spectral analyses to the FUSE data. We will use photometry to look for periodic signals in the FUSE time-tag data of the brightest targets that could be due to the spin or orbital periods of the systems. 
H905|8| | |Smith|Catholic University of America|Because of their repsective instrumental constraints, there has been remarkably little overlap sharp-lined OB stars observed spectroscopically by both FUSE and IUE satellites. In this survey program of some 17 stars, we propose to more than double the sample of B stars near the main sequence that will have been observed in both the far-UV and the middle-UV. We outline the types of scientific investigations that can be conducted from spectra of B,V stars, ranging from the study of individual Galactic stars, including the structure, chemical composition, and kinematics of their atmospheres, to the population syntheses of highly redshifted galaxies.
H906|8| | |Desert|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|We propose to study the interactions between known extra-solar planets and their hosting stars. We will tackle this challenging subject by using two different approaches. Firstly, we propose to look for auroral emissions (e.g., H_2 and H,sc i lines) in the spectra of stars hosting known extra-solar planets. Secondly, the same sets of spectra will be used to analyze the modulation of the stellar emission lines as a function of the planetary orbital phase. The detection of extra-solar planets aurorae will provide a new and crucial step for understanding the structure of these extra-solar planets, and their relation with their nearby parent stars. Also, a mapping of planet-induced activity at varying stellar atmospheric depths will allow characterization and quantification of the physical interaction between the magnetically heated layers of the star and the planets magnetosphere.
H907|8| | |Brown|University of Colorado|Young stars have very high levels of stellar activity (e.g. UV and X-ray emission) that can strongly influence the formation and evolution of their protoplanetary systems. The high energy emission, both as radiation and particles, resulting from magnetic activity on the central star controls the thermal structure of disks, the formation process of planetesimals, and the photoexcitation and photoionization of protoplanets and young planetary atmospheres. The dwarfs of the Local Association, whose ages range from 7 Myr to 200 Myr, are a remarkable sample of young stars very close (typically nearer than 0 pc) to the Sun that permit the detailed study of the evolution of stellar activity. We propose a Cycle 8 Survey project to enlarge the sample of older Local Association dwarfs with measured transition region (100,000 K) emission line fluxes.

I801|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|A series of 25 arcsec slews is executed in a spiral pattern about the LWRS aperture to try to find light in all four channels for the first time. This will be done as a single time-tag exposure. The primary data source is the detector counters. The default detector mask must be loaded prior to executing this program. This is followed by a one day interval to calculate the mirror movements required to co-align the channels to an accuracy of 25 arcsec. Finally, the target is recentered in the LWRS aperture. Then two series of linear slews are done, first in the X direction then in the Y direction. Each of these consists of 7 dwells separated by six slews, with each slew 5 arcsec in size. This will locate the edge of the slit to an accuracy of about 5 arcsec. A separate time-tag exposure will be taken during each of these linear slew sequences.

M101|0| |Dr. Jeffrey|Kruk|FUSE|This program defines the absolute photometric calibration of FUSE. The calibration will be defined by model atmosphere calculations of the spectra of DA white dwarfs. The fluxes of these stars are known to a few percent, all 6 from models and 4 of the 6 confirmed by HUT measurements.
M102|0| |Dr. Jeff|Kruk|FUSE|This program obtains one or more observations of a DB white dwarf to obtain a smooth continuum with no broad absorption lines at the wavelengths of the Lyman lines. This will provide a test of the flux calibration across the Lyman lines, where it is most subject to systematic errors in the DA stellar models.
M103|0| |Dr. Jeff|Kruk|FUSE|This program determines the stability of the FUV sensitivity of the FUSE instrument. This will be performed by observing a stable star such as a hot DA or DO white dwarf at regular intervals. This program, along with M101, will satisfy the requirements of SV program S305. This monitoring must be done through each slit, because some of the possible degradation mechanisms may affect different regions of the detector in different ways and the flux calibration files will have to be maintained separately for each slit. This program will also serve the purpose of measuring the relative slit throughput and slit transmission as a function of wavelength (SV program S306). This program will also incorporate monitoring of the telescope alignment and focus by means of a peak-up acquisition with small steps and (somewhat) long dwell times (a knife-edge test). This covers at least part of the SV program S402.
M104|0| |Dr. Alex|Fullerton|FUSE|Calibration program M104 provides the observational material required to derive flat-field information from HIST observations of bright stellar sources in the LWRS, MDRS, and HIRS science apertures.
M105|0| |Dr. Jean|Dupuis|FUSE|A sample of stars have been selected to monitor the degradation of FUSE's flux sensitivity on a weekly basis. As constraints on RAM angle pointing slowly get relaxed, it is important to prove that FUSE sensitivity is not unduly diminished. Most selected stars are photometrically stable white dwarfs and subdwarfs; most of which were previously observed with FUSE. The vast majority of targets are at high declinations to facilitate the observations.
M107|0| |Dr. Jeffrey|Kruk|FUSE|This program contains observations that will define the wavelength calibration for the FUSE spectrograph. The intent is to use the wavelength calibration found from the spectrograph alignment measurements performed at CU for the high-order terms in the polynomial fit, and to determine the lowest-order terms from the flight measurements. If this proves impractical, we will use flight data to define all terms in the calibration. We will use absorption lines from interstellar gas to define the wavelength calibration, though in some cases emission lines may be used also. In most cases information from other instruments at longer wavelengths will be required to assign absolute velocities to individual IS gas clouds. Stars will be added to this program as observations determine that they are useful for this purpose. Stars with a fairly dense distribution of absorption lines will be required to define the complete wavelength solution, but spectra with only a few widely-spaced lines in each spectral channel are required for monitoring the wavelength stability.
M108|0| |Dr. Jeff|Kruk|FUSE|This program obtains short snapshot observations of targets in order to assess their utility for various calibration activities.
M112|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|Target should nominally have a rate from 400 to 2000, although other rates can be accommodated. Field should be very FUV bare for a radius of 30 arcseconds around the target, to avoid confusion when looking at count rate versus time. Avoid picking guide stars near edge of field due to the SAMAs required for the scans. FES-assisted acquisition is preferred (if we are confident it will work with the chosen field) to minimize errors in target location. The test starts by slewing to the target. Note that the LWRS is used for this entire task. Do an immediate X and Y scan, no spiral required (2 arcsecond by 31 steps by 60 sec dwells in X and 2 arcseconds by 21 steps by 60 sec dwells in Y). Note that if required by MPS issues, the X scan can be shorted on both ends by as much as 5 steps in all cases (check with PI or LI before doing this). The " pre-dwell" X and Y scan may be deleted if absolutely necessary. Wait a minimum of 6 hours after arrival on the target before continuing. At the end of the 6 hours period, perform a 49 step spiral and a set of scans as above (do the Y first this time, X is first all other times). Downlink data, determine FPA X adjustment and/or mirror motions required to coalign to 4 arcseconds or better in Y and 2 arcseconds or better in X. From the time the data is downlinked, assume 2 passes plus 20 minutes until mirrors and/or FPAs are moved. Perform another set of X and Y scans (no spiral required), downlink and check the image locations.
M114|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|The purpose the M114 test is similar to that of the M112 program -- to scan an FUV bright target across the LWRS aperture in order to measure the alignment of LiF2, SiC1, and SiC2 relative to LiF1. Unlike M112, however, M114 test scans are " open loop" , and as such are much less intrusive than an interactive channel co-alignment. Instead, M114 scan data will be downlinked and analyzed while another science observation is ongoing, and mirror motions will be made, if necessary, at a later time. More efficient, more frequent channel updates will hopefully keep the channels consistently well aligned.

P101|1| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the O VI program will focus on understanding the character  of the O VI absorption in the Galactic halo along sight lines toward stars  and extragalactic continuum sources such as AGNs and QSOs.  Regions to be  explored include the Galactic poles, the inner Galaxy, and the outer  regions of the Milky Way halo.  The data obtained for this program will be  integrated with existing information from previous space missions to  provide a global picture of the hot gas content of the Milky Way halo.  A  portion of the time for this program will be used to make measurements of  the O VI emission from the diffuse halo gas, though this is a secondary  objective since such measurements depend sensitively on instrument  performance. There will be a large amount of auxiliary information obtained as part  of the O VI halo program.  The Science Team will rely heavily upon these  data to undertake additional investigations of the chemical composition and  physical properties of the ISM, the properties of hot stars and their  winds, and the far-UV continua and absorption line properties of AGNs and  QSOs.  Data from this program will also be used as a snapshot for  determining which extended sight lines are best suited for follow-up  studies of the D/H ratio.  (See abstracts for programs P104, P105, P111,  P115, and P117 for additional details.)
P102|1| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the O VI program will focus on understanding the character  of the O VI absorption in the Galactic disk at distances greater than ~ 1  kpc from the Sun.  The survey will provide information for a statistical  study of the O VI absorption properties as well as detailed studies of  regions already known to contain hot gas through X-ray emission  measurements (e.g., SNRs, radio continuum loops). Local interstellar medium data from the D/H program will be used to  understand the properties of the hot gas in the solar neighborhood.  There  will be an additional "mini-survey" of several binary systems at multiple  epochs to search for the presence of broad shallow O VI absorption due to  very hot interstellar gas through a precise tomographic reconstruction of  the stellar absorption in the vicinity of the O VI lines.  The Team will  also check for variability in the stellar O VI lines by observing several  objects with a range of spectral types several times during the mission. There will be a large amount of auxiliary information obtained as part  of the O VI disk program.  The Science Team will rely heavily upon these  data to undertake additional investigations of the chemical composition and  physical properties of the ISM and the properties of hot stars and their  winds.

Approximately 20 sight  lines will be investigated in the two galaxies.  The sight lines will  include superbubble structures with strong X-ray emission and field  positions with little X-ray emission.  The hot gas properties of the LMC  and SMC will be compared to those derived for the Milky Way. There will be a large amount of auxiliary information obtained as part of the O VI Magellanic Cloud program.

P104|1| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the D/H program will provide information for sight lines  confined to the local interstellar medium to determine the extent to which  the D/H ratio varies within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun.  These  observations will significantly increase the amount of information  available for local deuterium abundance determinations and will enhance the  information for the local interstellar medium available from earlier  Copernicus satellite studies.  Objects to be used as background sources  include cool stars, white dwarf stars, the central stars of planetary  nebulae, and a few A-type stars. Auxiliary uses for the data will include general ISM studies and a survey of hot gas within the Local Bubble.  (See abstracts for programs P102/122 and  P115 for additional details.)
P105|1| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the D/H program will provide information for sight lines  that extend beyond the local interstellar medium of the Galactic disk.  The  sight lines covered will sample gas in spiral arm and interarm directions  several kiloparsecs from the Sun.  Most of the objects observed will be  OB-type stars.  Data from program P102/122 (O VI disk survey) will provide  an initial far-UV observation of a large number of sight lines.  Many of  these sight lines will be re-observed for longer integration times (a  factor of 3-5x) as part of this program.  All of the P102/P122 sight lines  should be considered potential candidates for this study.

(See abstract for program P111  for more information.) The Team will also use this data for studies of  extragalactic O VI and H I absorption at low redshift.
P108|1| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the D/H program will provide extended observations of  extragalactic continuum sources for measurements of the D/H ratio in the  distant Galactic halo, high velocity clouds, and low redshift (z < 0.3)  absorption systems.

Deep observations of one or more  candidate QSOs will attempt to resolve the He II Ly alpha forest.  These  observations will discriminate between discrete structures and distributed  gas as sources of the He II opacity.  Detailed comparisons of the He II  forest lines and the H I Ly alpha forest lines will be used to determine  the ionization state of the absorbing structures and the shape of the  ionizing UV background spectrum.
P111|1| |G.|Kriss| |The nearest, brightest active galaxies have inspired our current vision  of the AGN paradigm.  These same galaxies have been imaged with HST, have  the highest S/N HST and IUE far-UV spectra, and have the best X-ray  spectra.  Prime goals for FUSE observations are the shape of the far-UV  continuum, the strength and velocity of the O VI emission line, strengths  of other far-UV lines such as C III 977 and N III 991, and the prevalence  of intrinsic absorption and Lyman limits.  FUSE observations will resolve  velocity structure in the O VI absorbing gas, and in any neutral hydrogen  gas.  Observations of Seyfert 2s (in addition to NGC 1068) will search for  strong line emission in O VI, C III, and N III indicative of shock-heated  gas.  FUSE will also be sensitive to any molecular gas (visible as H_2  absorption) along the line of sight.  In BAL QSOs, FUSE will be able to  measure the absorption in the EUV transitions of high ionization ions such  as Si XII.  The detailed observations of selected objects in this program  will supplement the more general surveys of AGN being used to explore O VI  absorption and the D/H ratio in the galactic halo.
P112|1| |W.|Oegerle| |We will search for the O VI 1032/1038 emission lines produced in the warm  (300,000 K) intracluster gas in the cooling flow clusters A2597, A2199 and  A1795.  The existence of this warm component of the ICM has never been  detected convincingly, although its presence is expected in the  conventional models of cooling flows.  These 3 clusters have strong cooling  flows derived from their X-ray emission (>100 Msun/yr), as well as strong  H-alpha emission from cool (10,000 K) gas in their cluster cores.Detection of the intermediate temperature gas at 300,000 K will provide a  strong link between these temperature regimes, and important information on  the thermal history of the gas in cooling flows.
P113|1| |George|Sonneborn| |FUV emission from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud will be observed  to characterize the shock interaction between the high-velocity ejecta and  circumstellar gas.  We will attempt to observe O VI emission and the full  blueward extent of the blue wing of Lyman-alpha, only part of which is  observable with STIS because of the high expansion velocity of the ejecta  (V>15,000 km/sec).  Emission from recombination lines from the inner  circumstellar ring may also be present.  The nearest companion star (Star  3) will also be observed.
P114|1| |William P.|Blair| |The FUSE Team Project on supernova remnants includes an absorption study  of the young Type 1a SN remnant SN1006 and studies of selected filamentary  emission regions in evolved galactic SNRs.  Observations of the  "Schweizer-Middleditch" star behind SN1006 will be used to search for a  broad absorption from Fe III 1123, using FUSE's high dispersion to resolve  contaminating stellar photospheric lines from the broad line.  The presence  of this line would indicate iron in the cool ejecta of the supernova.Observations of key, well-studied SNR emission filaments will be used to  study different kinds of shock wave-ISM interactions, including  nonradiative and radiative shocks, and thermally unstable regions.  FUSE  coverage of a range of ions and ionization stages at high spectral  resolution will provide a unique capability to diagnose the thermal,  chemical, and kinematic properties of these interactions.  Observations of  an X-ray bright region will be used to search for faint, high-ionization  lines never observed previously in spectra of SNRs.
P115|1| |J. Michael|Shull| |The FUSE PI team will study interstellar H_2 absorption spectra of  OB-stars in the Galactic halo, SMC, and LMC.  The H_2 lines will be used to  derive molecular abundances, the CO/H_2 and HD/H_2 ratios, rotational  populations, rotational temperatures, gas densities, and UV radiation field  in diffuse clouds.  We will measure the molecular abundances, including  CO/H_2 and HD/H_2, as a function of metallicity, and estimate the gas  pressure (nT) in the low halo.  We will also observe H_2 in planetary  nebulae toward hot central stars.
P116|1| |T. P.|Snow| |The FUSE PI team will observe 31 stars which lie behind translucent clouds  (i.e.  clouds having total visual extinctions of around 2 magnitudes or  greater), in order to determine the H_2 column densities (for all stars on  the list) and the H_2 rotational excitations (for the brighter stars on the  list).  The total H_2 column densities will be applied to studies of  gas-phase depletions and chemistry, while the rotational excitations will  be used to analyze the physical conditions (e.g.  cloud densities,  temperatures, and radiation fields).  In addition, the FUSE spectra will be  used to determine far-UV extinction curves for the program stars, and data  on lines of atoms and ions, as well as molecular transitions of species  other than H_2, will be used in a comprehensive analysis of cloud  abundances, depletions, and chemistry.
P117|1| |J. B.|Hutchings| |This program is intended to a) enable modelling of stellar winds from FUSE spectra combined with HST/IUE range spectra, which will  yield proper determination of the wind ionization balance.  The program  stars are selected mainly from the LMC and SMC and will be combined  with the Galactic star sample from other programs, to b) enable a  comparison of winds in stars with matched spectral type and luminosity  in the 3 different environments, since abundance is known to be an  important parameter in driving winds.  Spectral types range through WR,  and O3 to B2.  Exposures are designed to provide a minimum S/N of 30  over 0.2 Angstroms; in many cases this is exceeded.
P118|1| |J.|Linsky| |This program will obtain far-UV spectra of cool stars that span a broad  range of spectral type and luminosity class.  It is our intention to obtain  these spectra early in the FUSE program and to provide the spectra quickly  to the user community in order to guide potential guest investigators in  designing their observing programs.  The specific science objectives  include: (1) studying transition region dynamics (winds and downflows), (2)  modeling the thermal structure of transition regions, (3) measuring  electron densities, (4) search for low temperature coronae, (5) studying  molecular excitation and fluorescence processes, and (6) inferring how the  transition regions of spectroscopic binary systems differ from those of  single stars.
P119|1| |Alfred|Vidal-Madjar| |The purpose of this program is to provide new insight on the signatures of circumstellar gas around main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars.  For  some stars, the already detected gas may be the by-product of some activity  (like evaporation and/or collision of kilometer-sized bodies) in a young  planetary system in its clearing out phase.  Spectroscopic variations  observed around the targets stars (PMS, Herbig AeBe) present strong  similarities with the already observed ones, but the origin of the  circumstellar gas within these systems is still unclear.  Detection of  deuterium may help in identifying the origin of the gas.  These  observations are expected to allow the identification of the main form of  the gaseous phase (H_2, CO, OI, NI, CII ?) and provide information on the  ionization equilibrium of the zero radial velocity as well as of the  accreting gas.  Analysis of multiplet ratios will allow to probe the sizes  of the inflowing gas structures.  Also, in order to better understand the  evolution of circumstellar gas from young stellar objects to main sequence  stars, a few very young B-type stars are included as being members of a  binary system with a T-Tauri companion.
P120|1| |Paul D.|Feldman| |H_2 emissions from both Jovian auroral regions measured with the  high-throughput aperture (MDRS) will determine temperatures and  self-absorption.  Atomic H emissions from the bulge region measured by the  high resolution aperture (HIRS) will determine the dynamics of the bulge  and anti-bulge regions.  The high-throughput aperture will be used to  search for HD fluorescently pumped by solar Lyman-beta as well as to  determine if there is a correlation of the H_2 Lyman and Werner bands with  Lyman-alpha in the bulge region.  The excitation of H_2 in the atmosphere  of Saturn will be similarly studied.  Io Torus emissions will be measured  using the high-throughput aperture (MDRS) to determine ion velocity  profiles and with the large science aperture to search for minor  constituents.  Observations of Venus will address the question of the  atmospheric D/H ratio.
P122|1| |K.|Sembach| |(Galactic Disk)--continuationThis portion of the O VI program will focus on understanding the character of the O VI absorption in the Galactic disk at distances greater than ~ 1 kpc from the Sun.  The survey will provide information for a statistical study of the O VI absorption properties as well as detailed studies of regions already known to contain hot gas through X-ray emission measurements (e.g., SNRs, radio continuum loops). Local interstellar medium data from the D/H program will be used to understand the properties of the hot gas in the solar neighborhood.  There will be an additional "mini-survey" of several binary systems at multiple epochs to search for the presence of broad shallow O VI absorption due to very hot interstellar gas through a precise tomographic reconstruction of the stellar absorption in the vicinity of the O VI lines.  The Team will also check for variability in the stellar O VI lines by observing several objects with a range of spectral types several times during the mission. There will be a large amount of auxiliary information obtained as part of the O VI disk program.  The Science Team will rely heavily upon these data to undertake additional investigations of the chemical composition and physical properties of the ISM and the properties of hot stars and their winds.  Data from this program will also be used as a snapshot for determining which extended sight lines are best suited for follow-up studies of the D/H ratio.  (See abstracts for programs P104, P105, P115, and P117 for additional details.) Program P122 is a continuation of program P102.
P131|1| |S. D.|Friedman| |The properties of the interstellar medium on scale sizes of about 1 pc are  not well understood.  Even as fundamental a parameter as the range of cloud  sizes has not been measured properly.  Some data suggest only weak opacity  variations on scales of ~1 pc, and essentially none below 0.2 pc.  Other  data, especially in the UV and radio, suggest absorption line equivalent  width variations as great as 25-50% toward targets with separations smaller  than 3000 AU (~0.01 pc) at a distance of ~200 pc.  The goal of this program  is to observe closely spaced lines of sight toward spatially adjacent  targets in an open cluster (NGC2264, distance=750 pc) in order to measure  or place limits on various properties of clouds in the local interstellar  medium.  Among these properties are the sizes of the clouds and possible  anomalous abundances.  In addition, these observations may provide measures  of metallicity and depletion gradients across the face of the cluster.
P132|1| |J. W.|Kruk| |The hot metal-rich hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs known as PG1159 stars  provide a unique probe of the late stages of stellar evolution.  Present  theories of stellar evolution do not yet produce stars that match the  properties of PG1159 stars.  FUSE observations will provide improved data  on the surface compositions of these stars; in addition, the O VI resonance  line profiles will be searched for evidence of ongoing mass-loss.  The long  exposure on WD2117+341 is used to search for the effects of the pulsations  on certain diagnostic line profiles.  The 2000s exposure on HS2324 is a  snapshot: if the spectrum shows sufficient flux then some time will be  reallocated within the program.
P133|1| |Luciana|Bianchi| |Central stars of Planetary Nebulae (CSPN) are among the hottest stars in  the H-R diagram.  IUE and HST observations show that CSPN have significant  supersonic winds and mass loss.  Accurate measurements of the wind velocity  and mass loss rate in CSPN are a crucial to test of whether current  theories of radiation pressure accelerated winds apply to evolved, high  gravity stars, and to understand the formation and evolution of the nebular  shell, since the photons from the hot central star, and the momentum of its  supersonic wind are responsible for the ionization of the visible nebula,  and influence the dynamics of the expanding shell.  IUE and HST data give  only partial information about mass loss, since they can only observe the  (often saturated) resonance lines of CIV, SiIV and NV.  FUSE can observe  wind lines in a greater spread of species and ionization states, especially  the hot O VI 1032,1037 doublet, from which the wind ionization can be  determined accurately.  UV (IUE/HST) and optical spectra are already  available for a consistent analysis of photospheric and wind lines.  The  line profiles will be analyzed with different methods (SEI, SSBAL, EMISSEI)  to derive wind velocity, mass loss rate, gravity, temperature and  luminosity.  Moreover, measurements of the stellar continuum in the FUSE  range will yield better determinations of temperature and luminosity, both  because of the hot temperatures of the stars, and because nebular continuum  emission contaminates the flux of CSPN longwards of about 1400 Angstroms,  but drops drastically below 1300 Angstroms.  Therefore, FUSE spectra of  CSPN can help our understanding of mass loss mechanisms, PN formation and  evolution (physical interpretation of the morphology), nebular ionization,  and post-AGB evolution.
P134|1| |E. M.|Murphy| |We propose to look for the O VI 1032/1038 emission lines from hot gas in  the disk and halo of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 4631.  ROSAT  observations of NGC 4631 clearly show a concentration of soft X-ray  emission north of the galaxy's plane directly above an area of high star  formation activity.  The X-ray spectrum implies the presence of a soft  X-ray gas component at a temperature of less than 1 million degrees.  Since  O VI is the best diagnostic of gas at this temperature in the FUSE  bandpass, our measurements of the O VI emission strength will help us to  understand the physical state, total content, and scale height of hot gas  in the halo of NGC 4631.  These quantities can then be directly compared to  values derived for the Milky Way through the O VI Program.
P135|1| |T. B.|Ake| |FUSE will be used to study the nature of the unusual eclipsing  spectroscopic binary, epsilon Aurigae.  The most favored model of this  system is that the secondary object is a large, cold disk seen nearly  edge-on.  IUE and GHRS observations indicate the existence of a far-UV  excess compared to other A-F type supergiants, presumably from a hot star  in the center of the disk.  The main difficulty in interpreting the UV data  is that the primary star still contributes significant flux down to  1400-1500 Angstroms.  FUSE observations will perform a more direct  examination of the secondary, free from contamination by from the  photosphere of the primary star.  Measurements will be made to determine  the physical parameters of the central star, and study variability and gas  motions in the disk.
P151|1| |B. Y.|Welsh| |We will observe 4 early-type stars in the line-of-sight towards the  Monoceros Loop supernova remnant in order to investigate the dynamics,  ionization state and elemental abundances of the disturbed, absorbing  interstellar gas associated with the remnant.
P152|1| |B. Y.|Welsh| |We will repeatedly observe 4 early-type Herbig Be stars which are thought  to possess gaseous circumstellar disks.  Our investigation will focus on  the strong stellar FUV line profiles to determine the extent of time  variability due to mass loss and accretion processes.  We will also analyze  the physical state of the molecular absorption lines sampled in the  interstellar gas serendipitously observed in the line-of-sight to these  objects.
P153|1| |N. W.|Griffiths| |We will complete repeated exposures of the active late-type RS CVn starsAR Lac and HR 1099, and perform an extended exposure of the G8V star Xi Boo A.We will obtain a better description of the transition regions of these  stars by completing the full emission measure distribution and accurately  measuring the plasma electron density.  We hope to gain a detailed  understanding of the connection between magnetic activity at the  photospheric and transition region levels, and will search for solar-like  coronal mass streamers using O VI (1032,1038 Angstrom) line profiles.
P154|1| |O.H.W.|Siegmund| |We will repeatedly observe one pre-CV and one normal CV eclipsing binary  system to monitor the level of FUV flare activity that is routinely  observed in these systems in other wavelength bands.  We will observe the  FUV emission from the surrounding gas disk and wind, the white dwarf  companion, and a possible hot disk corona produced by EUV/X-ray radiation  from the white dwarf that photoionizes and heats the disk surface.
P163|1| |Erik|Wilkinson| |FUV spectra of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars show high temperature emission  lines from magnetically heated regions and excited molecular lines from the  circumstellar environment.  The FUSE region is still largely unexplored for  PMS stars and contains unique diagnostics such as the O VI doublet, H Lyman  lines, and the H_2 Lyman bands.  Our targets are the Classical T Tauri star  T Tau and the Herbig Ae star HD104237.  T Tau shows a rich UV spectrum of a  wide range of ionic and H_2 lines, while the UV spectrum of HD104237 shows  wind-dominated emission lines below 1500 A.
P164|1| |Erik|Wilkinson| |Zeta Aurigae/VV Cep eclipsing binary systems offer the most detailedmethod of studying mass loss from cool supergiant stars.  The FUV continuum  from the hot main-sequence secondary star provides a probe through the  outer atmosphere and wind of the evolved primary star.  The absorption  spectra obtained will allow detailed investigation of the flow properties  and ionization structure of these binaries, leading to improved mass-loss  rates and wind energy budgets.
P179|1| |A.|Dupree| |The densities, mass motions, and emission measures will be evaluated fora selection of single stars and binary systems containing cool stars with  various rotation periods to assess the effects of rotation upon the  structure and energy balance of a stellar atmosphere.  Most systems will be  observed 3 times.
P180|1| |Paul D.|Feldman| |FUSE will attempt to determine the argon/oxygen ratio in a  target of opportunity comet whose activity level and orbit are suitable for  the observation.  In addition, we will search for molecular hydrogen  released directly by the cometary nucleus and for neutral and singly  ionized nitrogen.  These measurements will be normalized to a water  production rate derived from the observed hydrogen Lyman series.
P184|1| |J. B.|Hutchings| |Three stars in M33/M31 will be observed to study their stellar winds. The disk-dominated supersoft binary X-ray source 0513-69 in the LMC will be  observed.  Three CV binaries will be observed, with readouts at intervals  which will sample their orbital and other variations.  These targets are  highly variable - maximum visible magnitude is given.
P186|1| |J.|Linsky| |The objectives of this program are to study the dynamics, thermal  structure, and energy balance in the transition regions of young stars,  including pre-main sequence and Pleiades age stars.  The observations will  address these questions by measuring the far-UV fluxes, line widths, and  Doppler shifts of the O VI and other far-UV transition region lines.  We  will be studying some young A-type stars to determine whether their  transition regions differ from those of cooler stars, and will analyze any  flares observed in these young stars and a reference late-M star.
P187|1| |R. F.|Malina| |PSR_0656+14: Measurement of surface thermal emission from neutronstars (NS) is essential to theories regarding the condensed matter state  equation, the thermal evolution of NS, and of NS atmospheres.  We propose  to conduct 50 Ang band FUV photometric observations of PSR B0656+14, an  X-ray, SXR and EUV bright isolated NS with an optical counterpart.  FUV  photometry will provide critical characterization of the NS's surface  thermal radiation.  Higher energy observations may be effected by poorly  established effects including magnetized atmospheres, chemical  compositions, temperature gradients and gravitational effects.  Optical  observations may be subject to non-thermal effects. V3885 Sgr: V3885 Sgr is one of the brightest nonmagnetic cataclysmic  variables.  We propose to observe V3885 Sgr for 5 to 6 contiguous FUSE  orbits, achieving a S/N of about 12 at full resolution even at the troughs  of the source's O VI absorption lines in each spectrum (assuming 2000 sec  visibility per orbit).  The primary purpose of the observations is to use  the source as a bright continuum against which to study local interstellar  absorption lines.  Although observed on Malina's Co-I Program, the data  will be analyzed in collaboration with members of the O VI Project.
P190|0| |Prof. Blair|Savage|University of Wisconsin|The star PG0832+675 lies projected toward HVC complex A and the LLIV arch. It was classified by Hambly et al. (1996) as a Post AGB star at a distance of 8.1 kpc. Previous observations of the CaII line (Ryans et al 1997) have shown that this star lies behind the LLIV arch. Thus, it will be possible to obtain a second good measurement of abundances and ionization in the LLIV arch. This would complement the data toward the AGN PG0804+761 (Richter et al. 2000), which lies less than 10 degrees from PG0832+675. Especially interesting would be a comparison of the ionization, since toward PG0804+761 N(HI) is much lower than toward PG0832+761 (3.4 vs 9.3E19 cm^-2, respectively). The CaII spectrum of this star does not show CaII associated with complex A. Hoewver, the detection limit is less than a factor 2 below the CaII abundance that is measured elsewhere in complex A. Since in HVCs and IVCsCaII is observed to vary by a factor 2-3 either way, the non-detection does not necessarily imply that the star lies in front of complex A. However, a non-detection of complex A absorption in the much stronger UV line would set a lower distance limit of 8 kpc, constraining complex A to lie between 8 and 10 kpc. If on the other hand complex A does lie in front of the star, this star would provide maybe the only opportunity to measure abundances that HVC.
P191|1| |J. Michael|Shull| |We will observe a blue, metal-poor, star-forming galaxy, Mrk 357 (z =  0.053) shortward of its (rest-frame) Lyman limit to measure or set limits  on the Lyman continuum escape fraction.  This fraction constrains the HI  opacity and topology of gas layers in the parent galaxy and its halo, and  it gauges the potential contribution of starbursts to the metagalactic  (IGM) radiation field.  A related goal is to use the spectrum longward of  the Lyman limit for better understanding the star, dust and gas content of  the galaxy.
P192|1| |O.H.W.|Siegmund| |We shall observe two relatively unobscured T Tauri stars to investigate the  emission from accreting hot gas known to be present in these systems from  previous IUE data.  Observations of these emission processes will help in  understanding the role of circumstellar disk gas in these pre-main sequence  systems.
P193|1| |T. P.|Snow| |Studies under this program fall into three distinct categories:  (1) a detailed analysis, with enhanced S/N, of the spectra of two stars (HD  24534 = X Persei; and HD 23180 = o Per) for interstellar lines, with  emphasis on weak molecular features and lines below 1000 Angstroms; (2) a  study of absorption and emission in the spectra of three planetary nebula  central stars; and (3) a search for UV diffuse bands as stationary features  in the spectra of high- amplitude spectroscopic binaries.
P198|1| |Alfred|Vidal-Madjar| |IZW18 is known to be a blue compact galaxy presenting a very low  metallicity.  The purpose of this investigation is to search for H_2 in the  context of such a low metallicity, probably dust free object.  A high  velocity cloud is also present along this line of sight.  These  observations will allow the precise evaluation of a much longer exposure to  further study both the galaxy and the intervening high velocity cloud. Several programs can also be done simultaneously by observing the central  stars of some bright Planetary Nebulae (PN): (a) The wavelength range is particularly appropriate to study the continuum, the temperature and the wind of the PNe central stars; (b) In addition to the stellar continuum, the spectra will yield information concerning the nebula; (c) FUSE will offer the possibility to detect molecular hydrogen lines in absorption against the stellar continuum. It should then be possible to determine how much additional H_2 is formed by shocks in the stellar winds. (d) Finally, the non-detection of deuterium should allow a direct check of its evolution within stars since these PN were selected for their different 3He environment.
P203|3| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the O VI program will focus on understanding the character  of the O VI absorption in the Magellanic Clouds.  Approximately 20 sight  lines will be investigated in the two galaxies.  The sight lines will  include superbubble structures with strong X-ray emission and field  positions with little X-ray emission.  The hot gas properties of the LMC  and SMC will be compared to those derived for the Milky Way. There will be a large amount of auxiliary information obtained as part of the O VI Magellanic Cloud program.  The Science Team will rely heavily upon these  data to undertake additional investigations of the chemical composition and  physical properties of the ISM in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, as well as the properties of hot stars and their winds (See abstract for programs P115 and P117 for additional details.)
P204|3| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the D/H program will provide information for sight lines  confined to the local interstellar medium to determine the extent to which  the D/H ratio varies within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun.  These  observations will significantly increase the amount of information  available for local deuterium abundance determinations and will enhance the  information for the local interstellar medium available from earlier  Copernicus satellite studies.  Objects to be used as background sources  include cool stars, white dwarf stars, the central stars of planetary  nebulae, and a few A-type stars. Auxiliary uses for the data will include general ISM studies and a survey of hot gas within the Local Bubble.  (See abstracts for programs P102/122 and  P115 for additional details.)
P205|3| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the D/H program will provide information for sight lines  that extend beyond the local interstellar medium of the Galactic disk.  The  sight lines covered will sample gas in spiral arm and interarm directions  several kiloparsecs from the Sun.  Most of the objects observed will be  OB-type stars.  Data from program P102/122 (O VI disk survey) will provide  an initial far-UV observation of a large number of sight lines.  Many of  these sight lines will be re-observed for longer integration times (a  factor of 3-5x) as part of this program.  All of the P102/P122 sight lines  should be considered potential candidates for this study.
P207|3| |K.|Sembach| |This portion of the D/H program will provide short observations of many  AGNs and QSOs to check far ultraviolet flux levels and suitability of the  objects as background continuum sources for extended integrations.  The  data produced from this snapshot survey will be used extensively as part of  program P111 to study the flux distribution and intrinsic absorption  properties of the AGNs and QSOs observed.  (See abstract for program P111  for more information.) The Team will also use this data for studies of  extragalactic O VI and H I absorption at low redshift.
P210|2| |G.|Kriss| |FUSE will provide an opportunity to explore absorption by He II in the  intergalactic medium (IGM) over the redshift range z=2-3.  The planned  observations will measure the mean opacity of the IGM in coarse bins over  this redshift interval to study the patchiness of the IGM over different  lines of sight as a function of redshift.  Deep observations of one or more  candidate QSOs will attempt to resolve the He II Ly alpha forest.  These  observations will discriminate between discrete structures and distributed  gas as sources of the He II opacity.  Detailed comparisons of the He II  forest lines and the H I Ly alpha forest lines will be used to determine  the ionization state of the absorbing structures and the shape of the  ionizing UV background spectrum.
P211|2| |Richard|Green|NOAO|We will monitor the highly variable O VI emission and associated absorption  in three bright Seyfert galaxies.  The screening observations for good AGN  sightlines are, of course, taken at arbitrary times with respect to AGN light  curves.  In several cases of well-known Seyfert galaxies, FUSE caught them in a  low state.  To our surprise, the typical broad emission line expected for O VI  had nearly vanished, leaving a narrower line component that was essentially  invisible when observed in a high state by HUT.  The emission velocity widths  fall in the range of 400-800 km/s.  Two different scenarios may explain the  observations, and both may be operative to some degree.  There may be an  extended  narrow-line region  in O VI.  When the broad line region fades as  ionizing flux drops, the narrow-line component remains more nearly constant  but gains prominence in the observed spectrum.  Alternatively, there may be  bi-conical outflow as in NGC 4151.  As the accretion state changes, the  structure of this focused wind changes both in ionization and density.  The  velocity spread and strength of O VI depends on the physical details of where in the flow the line is produced.  An additional diagnostic is provided by the  associated absorption.  The degree to which it covers the broad line, narrow  line, and continuum places the absorbing gas geometrically and constrains the  location of the emission-line gas. The extent to which the strength of  absorption varies with the continuum and emission components gives further  information about its location in the nuclear region.
P213|2| |George|Sonneborn| |FUV emission from SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud will be observed  to characterize the shock interaction between the high-velocity ejecta and  circumstellar gas.  We will study observe O VI emission and the full  blueward extent of the blue wing of Lyman-alpha, only part of which is  observable with STIS because of the high expansion velocity of the ejecta.Emission from recombination lines from the inner circumstellar ring may also be  present.  The nearest companion stars (Star 2 and 3) will also be observed.
P214|2| |William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to observe the four Balmer-dominated (Type Ia) SNRs in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  These objects will all be observed with Chandra, so FUSE observations will provide information on OVI line intensities for comparison with OVII and OVIII from the soft X-ray region.  The combined data will provide strong constraints on the dominant emission mechanism operating in young SNRs arising from Type Ia supernovae.  The LMC set of objects is unique in permitting reasonable estimates of the total OVI emission from each object  with relatively little foreground extinction.
P215|2| |Michael|Shull|University of Colorado|The fundamental physical and chemical processes at work in molecular clouds are key objects of FUSE science.  Preliminary results on H2 in the LMC, based on available PI Team data, suggest a reduced molecular fraction in the low-metallicity LMC gas.  Although this result provides  the first direct evidence of a metallicity dependence in the formation  rate of interstellar H2, the available FUSE targets do not sample the  high-extinction regime where the correlation between E(B--V) and molecular  fraction is strong.  Therefore, we cannot test whether the apparent  reduction in molecular fraction is due to reduced formation rates, high  radiative destruction rates, or selection effects. We propose observations  of 7 LMC stars and 2 SMC stars with E(B--V) = 0.20 -- 0.42, which will  allow us to test cloud models that incorporate different assumptions about  the formation rate of H2 as a function of metallicity. We will also obtain CO emission maps in these selected regions to assess the CO/H2ratio in this gas.  As a key goal of FUSE H2 science, this test can be applied only to sight lines for which the variation of molecular fraction with extinction can be tightly controlled.
P216|2| |Theodore P.|Snow|University of Colorado|This Cycle 2 program plans observations of 11 stars (in addition to  the original list) as an add-on to our  medium  project to study molecular hydrogen in translucent clouds.  The new stars have been selected on the basis of reddening, known extinction and interstellar line parameters, and inclusion in the comprehensive survey of diffuse interstellar bands being carried out by group member Don York and  collaborators (e.g. Snow, Welty et al.).
P217|2| |Alex|Fullerton|University of Victoria|The primary goal of the FUSE P117  Hot Star  program is to characterize the stellar winds of a representative sample of early-type stars in the Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), in order to study the properties of mass-loss via stellar winds as a function of metallicity.  Information about the ionization balance, velocity law, and mass-loss rates associated with these winds can be derived from modeling. However, in order to understand the behavioral trends of these properties, good coverage of the relevant temperature and luminosity classes is required. Through P117 and other PI-team programs, this spectral domain is well covered for Galactic OB and WR stars. However, the existing coverage of parameter space for the LMC and SMC is biased toward supergiants and hotter stars. With this proposal, we seek to mitigate these biases by supplementing the original sample of PI and GI targets in the LMC and SMC with objects of lower luminosity.  This additional coverage of the H-R diagram will enable us to determine where the stellar wind  turns off,  and the dependence of this point on metallicity.  Objects in the SMC are particularly interesting, since their abundances reflect the metallicities - and hence the behavior of stellar winds - in the early universe.
P218|2| |Andrea|Dupree|Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|This program will obtain far-UV spectra of cool stars that span a broad range of spectral type and luminosity class.  The specific science objectives include: (1) studying transition region dynamics (winds and downflows), (2) modeling the thermal structure of transition regions, (3) measuring electron densities, (4) search for low temperature coronae, (5) studying molecular excitation and fluorescence processes, and (6) inferring how the transition regions of spectroscopic binary systems differ from those of single stars. All five targets have been previously observed with FUSE, and their spectra assessed. They indicate that FUSE will identify the source of the stellar coronal holes and define the acceleration and transition region densities over the cool half of the HR diagram. However, further observations are required to improve the quality of the line profiles from which conclusions can be drawn. In particular we require observations during orbial night-time to remove any uncertainties due to solar and airglow contamination.
P219|2| |Alfred|Vidal-Madjar|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|The purpose of this program is to obtain new spectra of the most important targets of the Circumstellar disk program (P119, Q119, Q219) which aims to observe the signatures of circumstellar gas around main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars. The objective of this program is to monitor the spectroscopic variabilities of the targets for which FUSE spectra have already been obtained or will be obtained in the coming months. The selected targets have already shown signature of spectroscopic variations in the UV or the visible. Although these variations are often  interpreted in terms of proto-planetary activity, a clear understanding is still to be established. Further observations and studies are thus needed.
P221|2| |John|Hutchings|HIA, NRC of Canada|The observation is of reddened stars in the SMC which will yield an far UV extinction curve for this galaxy. UV extinction in galaxies of low metal abundance are of high interest in current cosmology research as well as in understanding the evolution of our neighbour galaxy. The early universe is seen at rest UV wavelengths because of redshifting, but the energy budget and completeness will not be known until proper allowance is made for extinction. It is known that the SMC UV extinction curve is steeper and different in shape from that seen in the more evolved environment of  our Galaxy. The extension of this to the Lyman limit is not known and of high importance as it rises with decreasing wavelength.
P222|2| |Rosina|Iping|CUA, NASA/GSFC/LASP|Eta Carinae, located in the association Trumpler 16 in the Carina Nebula (NGC  3372), was observed by FUSE in February and March 2000 and was found to have  surprisingly bright far uv fluxes and strong H2 absorption. If circumstellar nature  of H2 can be established, this would be the first detection of molecules in the eta Car nebulosity.  Do the large FUV fluxes provide evidence for or against a binary  companion of eta Car or constrain the mass of this object? In an effort to  clearly distinguish between the interstellar and circumstellar material,  three OB stars close (within 1 arcmin) to Eta Carinae, Trumpler 16 will be observed.Additional lines of sight close to eta Car  should help to  better understand the  ISM near eta Car. To complement the observation of eta Carinae, three other luminous  blue variables, P Cygni, AG Carinae and HR Carinae will be observed. Comparison of  additional LBVs with eta Car will help to establish in what way  they are similar and/or  different.  P Cygni is especially important because  it is widely regarded as an eta Car analog in terms of its UV properties  (Ebbets et al. 1997, ApJ, 489, L161). These observations will give us a better understanding what  LBV's look like in the FUV.
P223|2| |Derck|Massa|Raytheon STX|HD 5980 is the brightest star in the SMC and indicative of the luminous objects which dominate the light from distant, metal poor, young galaxies (Koenigsberger et al., 2000, ApJ, 542, 428).  HD 5980 is also an eclipsing WN+O binary with an eccentric orbit and a period of 19.26 days (Breysacher & Perrier 1980, A&A, 90, 207).  In addition, in 1994 one component of the system underwent a Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) outburst of the sort experienced by the most luminous stars in the universe (Moffat et al. 1998, ApJ, 497, 896).  The binary nature of HD 5980 is fortuitous, since it allows us to determine far more about the object than we could ever glean from a single star.  Because the two components have different temperatures, observations of the eclipses at different wavelengths reveal different aspects of the stars.To probe the massive winds of the binary, to attempt to disentangle the contributions of the two components and to make unambiguous identifications of the ISM lines along the line of sight, better phase coverage of the orbit is essential.  Three observations near each of the two eclipses (phases 0.00 and 0.36) and one near each opposition (phases 0.13 and 0.78), where the line of sight to the system does not intersect the interacting winds.
P224|2| |Allan|Willis|University College London|It is proposed to secure FUV spectra of the qWR star HD45166. These data will provide measurents of qWR emission lines in important  species like CIII, CIV, SIV, SVI, OVI, NIII. Their analysis using state of  the art, nLTE model atmosphere techniques will determine the fundamental  properties of the low mass, qWR star, and fix its evolutionary status.
P231|2| |Martial|Andre|John Hopkins University|The Oxygen abundance is a critical point for D/H measurements with FUSE since D/O can be determined with greater accuracy. Using the  Copernicus data, astronomers found a depletion of Oxygen in the gaz phase (com pared to solar abundance) and started to investigate the O/H(total) ratio in the LISM. From Deboer et al (1981) to Keenan et al(1985), the determination of this ratio proved to be difficult and nothing could been said about possible variations because of the scatter of data and the error bars. Then, using GHRS data, Meyer at al (1998) tried to set a  Definitive Oxygen Abundance  and found 50 % depletion in the LISM (gaz phase). Still, the survey implied only 13 targets so that nothing can be said as to variation or gradient. In particular, distant targets are required to test the metal poor infall scenario (to explain the LISM depletion) but such targets show strong H2. The next step would be to improve the statistic but to do so means to be able to choose a large sample of targets for which a non negligible fraction of H may be in H2 molecules. The most useful sample of targets comes from the Lauroesch survey (STIS 1998) where lines of sight were selected to show 1356 A OI transition. From this survey, I extracted 19 very nice lines of sight, showing clear velocity structure and no blending. Actually, 14 of them are planned FUSE target or already in the FUSE archive. Among the 5 other targets, 3 have a E(B-V) greater than .2 and FUSE is the only instrument able to give their H2 column density.
P232|2| |Charles G.|Hoopes|Johns Hopkins University|I am proposing to observe the central star of the HII region N44C in the LMC, as well as the surrounding ionized gas. This HII region contains HeII emission, but the central star has been classified as type O7, not hot enough to produce the 54 eV photons necessary to ionize HeII.  With a FUSE spectrum we can search for other highly ionized elements requiring photon energies similar to that of HeIII. The recombination time of these elements can constrain and perhaps eliminate the hypothesis that the ionization source has turned off. We can also determine the metallicity in the region to see whether enrichment by an evolved companion has occurred, and use the stellar spectrum to refine the spectral classification.
P233|2| |Giovanni|Catanzaro|Johns Hopkins University|Magnetic Chemically Peculiar (CP) stars are characterised by spectral,  photometric and magnetic variations with a common period. In the oblique  rotator model, proposed by Stibbs (1950), chemical elements are not  homogeneusly distribuited on the stellar surface, and the observed variations  are due to the stellar rotation. The anomalous abundances are caused by diffusion process (Michaud, 1970). Magnetic fields are suspected to influence the diffusion by suppressing mass-motions and changing the path of ionised species (Michaud et al., 1981),  so that diffusion in CP stars results in a non-homogeneous distribution of  elements over the stellar surface. The vertical stratification of chemical elements in the atmospheres of CP stars was predicted from results of radiative diffusion processes. In order to study  this phenomenon, one attempt we can make is to compute chemical abundances by  measuring different lines of the same element, formed at different layers of  the atmosphere. FUSE offers the possibility to look very deep in the atmosphere of these stars,  so it is possible to select a number of spectral lines, that together with other lines observed in optical spectra, will furnish an unique opportunity to  improve our knowledge about vertical stratification.
P234|2| |Ravi|Sankrit|Johns Hopkins University|We will obtain MDRS spectra at two locations near a Balmer filament in the northeast region of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant.  The first position will be ahead of the filament and the second will be behind it.  These observations will supplement the spectra taken at three locations on the filament (part of FUSE program P114).  The OVI flux was found to decrease as a function of position downstream behind the shock front.  Weak emission on the wings of the primary OVI 1032 component was detected at all three locations.  The flux in these weaker components was about the same in all three spectra.  The current observations are designed to measure the OVI flux in regions away from the filament.  This will allow us to examine the OVI emission that may be present, arising from regions other than the shocked gas in the Balmer filament.  We expect he same strength in each of the spectra. The current observations are designed to measure the OVI flux in regions away from the filament.  From these measurements we will be able to estimate the contribution of sources other than the primary shock to the total OVI flux in the remnant.  In addition to the spectra in the primary aperture (MDRS) we will obtain data in the LWRS aperture, from which we will obtain the OVI flux in regions about 3.5 arcminutes away, but still within the remnant.
P235|2| |Paule|Sonnentrucker|Johns Hopkins University|Diffuse Interstellar Bands (DIBs) are absorption features detected mainly in  the optical. Even though the DIB carriers have been proven to be most likely  carbonaceous in nature and reside in the gas phase, their origin remains a  complete mystery  (Herbig, 1995 for a review). Former studies indicated that some (DIBs) are weaker in reflection nebulae than in diffuse clouds of  equivalent reddening. Few attempts were made to explain the DIBs peculiar behavior toward those particular environments. However, this issue widely  remains unexplored because the line of sight properties toward reflection  nebulae are not always well constrained. I, therefore, propose to observe the  reflection nebulae HD190603 and HD198478 to derive the column density of H2,  CI, CI* and CI**, PII, ArI, FeII, NI, estimate the molecular fraction in order to study these lines of sight properties and relate them to the DIBs, CaI, CaII, NaI, CH and CH+ column densities measured in the optical. In addition, the  extinction curves of HD190603 and HD198478 only differ in the FUV non-linear  rise portion. Since the FUV non-linear rise is thought to be due to very  small grains (or large molecules) in a neutral form, assessing the role of  the FUV non-linear rise on to the DIBs, H2 and the metals in the FUSE passband will give further information on the properties of these two lines of sight and the DIB carriers survival/destruction conditions.
P241|2| |Nicolas|Lehner|The Johns Hopkins University|Young B-type stars are known to exist in the Magellanic Bridge (MB) gas, a region of material between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, implying that star formation is still occurring in the MB. In all known environments star formation occurs within molecular clouds, but there is yet no direct evidence of star-forming clouds in the MB. FUSE will allow for the first time to make a direct sensitive search for molecular hydrogen in the MB and give more insights on the possible star formation mechanisms in low density and metallicity environments. The proposed targets are two young hot stars, DI1388 and DGIK975, and not only search for molecular hydrogen will be made possible, but a detailed investigation of the physical conditions within the MB gas will be studied in different spatial positon (DGIK975 is near the LMC while DI1388 is near the SMC). In particular, using our previous HST STIS, the FUSE observations will allow us to place limit or measurements on the ratios of C III/C II, S III/S II, N III/N II/N I, Fe III/Fe II, Si IV/O VI and C IV/O VI. Finally, an HVC was detected in the DI1388 STIS spectra and was found to be nearly fully ionized. FUSE observations will help to place a constrain on the ionization origin by studying the ionic ratio of several species.
P242|2| |Orsola|De Marco|American Museum of Natural History|We are going to take an observation of the dwarf nova SS Cygni during quiescence to measure elemental abundances in the atmosphere of the  exposed white dwarf component of this binary. We expect that the absolute  abundances will yield clues about the past outbursting history of the system.  In particualr, as is the case for the dwarf nova VW Hyi, we might detect  abundaces characteristic of thermo-nuclear processing, which would indicate that SS Cyg experienced a nova outburst  sometime in its past. Such finding would contribute substantially in unifying the dwarf nova and nova outburst scenarios.
P243|2| |Charles G.|Hoopes|Johns Hopkins University|I propose to obtain a 10 ksec LWRS spectrum of the WR star AV336a in the SMC. This star is surrounded by a HeII nebula (Garnett et al. 1991), one of only six known in the Local Group. The presence of HeII emission requires that the ionizing star emit photons with energy greater than 54 eV, which in turn requires a stellar effective temperature of 70,000 - 80,000 K. Wolf-Rayet stars have temperatures in the 30,000 - 60,000 K range (Conti 2000), and in fact no population I stars are known to have temperatures as high as those required by the HeII emission. Either AV336a is a very rare type of star, or else the ionization source in this HII region is not understood.  The FUSE bandpass provides a unique opportunity to study both AV336a and the surrounding HeII nebula. The stellar spectrum will provide information on the stellar winds and abundances, which will shed light on the unusual nature of this star. Secondly, the absorption spectrum of the intervening material in the HeII nebula will provide information about other highly ionized elements. The adjacent ionization stages of PIII, IV, and V and S III, IV, and VI in the FUSE bandpass, as well as other ionized gas diagnostic lines, will be used to measure the luminosity of the star at energies well above the Lyman limit, providing a strict diagnostic of the stellar temperature. The spectrum will also be used to search for high velocity gas that would indicate shock ionization.
P247|2| |Peter|Young|Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|44i Boo is a W UMa type contact binary at a distance of 12.8 pc with an orbital period of 6.4 hours and an inclination of 72.8 degrees, so that there are two eclipses per orbit. X-ray and UV emission from highly-ionised ions have revealed that 44i Boo exhibits a corona, but that the emission levels are below those of rapidly rotating single stars or short-period, detached binaries, indicating that the dynamo is being inhibited by the physics associated with the contact. By categorising in detail the nature of the corona of 44i Boo, one may shed light on how the magnetic dynamo operates in stars. With FUSE it will be possible to use the high spectral resolution and sensitivity of the instrument to monitor line fluxes and profiles of the strong C III 977 and O VI 1032 emission lines during the orbit, as well as use the temperature coverage of these and weaker lines to compare with the atmospheric models made with previous instruments.
P248|2| |Peter|Young|Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|AG Draconis is a symbiotic star consisting of a K giant and white dwarf. The UV is dominated by emission lines from a nebula believed to be around the white dwarf. AG Dra was observed by FUSE on 16-March-2000 as part of the science verification program for FUSE. This short (~2400s) observation produced a high quality spectrum revealing emission lines from several species, including O VI, Ne V, Ne VI, S IV, S VI and He II. A further observation of AG Dra is planned to determine the geometry of the nebula, attribute the wind to one of the two stars, and to obtain a full exposure in the SiC channels which will be needed to obtain a density for the nebula.
P249|2| |Martial|Andre|John Hopkins University|Deuterated molecules are another means of determining the Deuterium abundance. With Copernicus, H2 and HD nolecules were observed in absorption in the ultraviolet in diffuse clouds such as that toward Zeta Oph. Nevertheless, very low HD/H2 ratios were found, reflecting the atomic nature of these clouds. With FUSE, we can use denser molecular clouds within which one might expect H and D to be in their molecular form. In such cases, molecular fractionation correction is not required and direct measurement of D/H could result from HD/H2 ratios.  Until recently, HD/H2 measurements were limited to these  few good candidates where the velocity structure could allow for an isolated translucent intervening cloud, but saturation and low S/N of these detections implied large uncertainties on the result. For one of the translucent cloud's targets, however, high S/N detection of HD is present.  The star HD206267 lies behind the translucent cloud DC 1107.  Within a few arc min to the star, and showing the same reddening (E(B-V) ~.4) we found 2 fuv bright stars : BD+56 2617C and BD+56 2617D. These 3 stars could possibly illuminate the same cloud whose aera is grater than 10 deg steradian on the sky (very close). Such a configuration is what we need to argue for a HD reservoir inside the cloud.
P250|2| |Aki|Roberge|Johns Hopkins University|The circumstellar disks medium team projects (P119 and Q119) have produced  remarkable spectra, showing emission and absorption features arising  from gasses that have a wide range in temperature, from hot OVI emission to  cold H_2 and CO absorption.  The emission from the highly-ionized species was  unexpected, as standard stellar theory predicts that these stars (with spectral  types earlier than about F0) should not have convective outer layers, and  therefore, should not have chromospheres, coronae, or strong stellar winds.While these stars clearly do show stellar activity, the exact nature is unclear.  AB Aurigae shows strong stellar winds and it is thought that the highly-ionized species may be formed by shocks in the wind.  Beta Pic, on the other hand, shows emission from OVI and CIII, but no trace of stellar winds.  Since Beta Pic is older than AB Aur, this difference  might indicate that the stellar activity is changing (possibly decreasing) with age.  To demonstrate this, we need to study young stars with a variety  of ages.  Unfortunately, most of the targets in P119 and Q119 are younger  than about 10 Myr; Beta Pic is the only one that is clearly older  (age ~ 20-30 Myr).  We therefore propose to observe another nearby young  star with a CS disk, HD 141569 (spectral type B9 Ve, d=99 pc), that is  thought to be a more evolved object (age > 10 Myr).  This star's CS disk was imaged with NICMOS (Weinberger et al. 1999), which  showed a remarkable gap in the dust disk.  This gap may most easily be  explained by the gravitational influence of one or more planets orbiting  the star. (Go to http://oposite.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pr/1999/03/index.html to see the NICMOS image and HST press release).  This makes HD 141569 a very  interesting object, as well as providing additional evidence that it is a  relatively evolved young star.
P251|2| |Cristina|Oliveira|Johns Hopkins University|I propose to observe the white dwarf WD2247+583 (Lan 23) and measure the D/O ratio along this line of sight. If the O/H ratio is ~ constant as the work of Meyer et al (ref 3) seems to indicate and the D/H is also ~ constant then we would expect that D/O is also ~ constant. Preliminary analysis of several lines of sight using FUSE data have not yet been able to show a definite correlation between N(DI) and N(OI) and so more measurements along different lines of sight are needed. Previous measurements using EUVE data (ref 1) have placed the HI column density at 716 < N(HI) < 1596 x10^17 cm^-2. Using a D/H ratio of 1.2x10^-5 this places the DI column between 8.6 x10^14 and 1.9x10^15 (cm^-2). This will be an interesting measurement since DI is typically measured in lines of sight with low HI column density (N(HI)~10^18 cm ^-2) and we'll be probing the D/O ratio in a regime that is not very explored. The effective temperature and gravity of this white dwarf indicates that the stellar continuum will be relatively smooth and continuum placement won't be a major uncertainty in measuring N(DI) as is the case with other types of white dwarfs.
P252|2| |Anne|Pellerin|Universite Laval|I propose to study young stellar populations in the nuclear  region of the starburst galaxy NGC 5430. This project is part  of my thesis which adresses the question of an evolutionary  relation between nuclear starbursts and AGN (based on Weedman et  al. 1998 and Heckman et al. 1997). For my thesis, a large sample of starbursts  and AGNs are to be considered in order to establish a scenario on  how nuclear starbursts may evolve into an AGN based on the importance  of a nuclear bar (Friedli et al. 1995). Although the FUSE archives  already contain spectra for a variety of nuclear starbursts and AGN,  none of them are characterized by a strong nuclear bar.  The goal of  this proposal is to obtain a FUV spectrum of the starburst galaxy  NGC 5430, which does have such a bar.
P263|2| |Erik|Wilkinson|University of Colorado|HST/STIS GTO observations of HD104237 are being planned during 2001 using 4 HST orbits to observe the star using 2 orientations of coronagraphic imaging, and then obtaining two UV spectra, one a G140M spectrum at H Lyman alpha with an orientation determined from the coronography, and the other a G140L spectrum  with the same orientation. We would like to obtain a second epoch FUSE observation of HD104237 contemporaneous with the STIS UV spectroscopy, in order to measure the full temperature structure of the circumstellar environment around this young intermediate mass star and to investigate whether the FUV spectrum of this star is as variable as the spectra from other Herbig Ae stars. This star has very few HST observing constraints and thus FUSE observation scheduling can be the primary driver for when these observations occur.
P267|2| |Jim|Green|CASA, University of Colorado|HST/STIS+G140M data of the MRK1383 sightline reveal an extremely broad, but relatively weak, low-z Ly-alpha absorber. We propose to use FUSE to search for OVI absorption  associated with this absorber to search for hot gas in the very local universe.
P301|3| |William|Blair|The Johns Hopkins University|The D-to-H ratio toward the star gamma2Vel has been measured to be anomalously high by IMAPS, while the value toward zetaPup (about 8 degrees away) is apparently normal.  We request observations of additional stars in the Vela-Puppis region in an attempt to either confirm or refute the high value toward gamma2Vel and to exercise various bright star observing techniques.  Many of the stars are very bright and will require special techniques to observe.  One is actually quite faint and will require a moderately long integration. Since bright target observing is not yet standard, planners should exercise considerable caution in scheduling these observations. Some hand scripting will be required.
P302|3| |William|Blair|The Johns Hopkins University|A major goal of the PI team program is to measure the D-to-H ratio (or its surrogate, D-to-O) in stars beyond the local ISM.  Recent work indicates that subdwarf O stars may be the best type of target for accessing the intermediate region from ~100 to 1000 pc or more. This program strives to expand the sample of target stars in this distance range available for D-to-H analysis. In the process, excellent spectra of the subswarf stars themselves will also be obtained.
P303|3| | |Williger| |The scatter in D/H values measured at high redshift suggests that the gas involved may have undergone some stellar processing. It is therefore important to understand the role of chemical evolution with respect to the deuterium abundance.  The variatio ns in the Galactic ISM D/H ratio can shed light on the effects of star formation history and mixing processes.  A comparison of the local D/H value, which appears to be stable aqt 1.5+-0.2e-4, can be compared to more distant regions which have undergone varying amounts of stellar processing. We request observations of OB stars with distances beyond the Local Bubble to explore the variation of D/H in a variety of environments. Some of the stars are very bright and will require special techniques to observe.  Others are actually quite faint and will require moderately long integrations.
P306|3| |G.|Kriss|Space Telescope Science Institute|In March 2003, the quasar HS1700+64 was found (as part of program C123) to be 2-3 times brighter than in the past. This quasar was used for the first measurements of He II opacity in the intergalactic medium by HUT.  It is currently brighter than HE2347-4342, the quasar first observed by FUSE for resolving the He II Lyman alpha forest in the IGM, giving us a unique opportunity to obtain high quality measurements of the He II opacity along another sight line through the IGM. The data in this program, when combined with C123 and the Z012 DOT program, will give a final spectrum of the same quality as that obtained on HE2347-4342. These two quasars are the only ones known with clear lines lines of sight to the He II Ly-alpha foresy that can be observed with FUSE.
Q101|1| | |Gry|Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille and ISO Data Center|We propose to study the H_2 excitation, as well as the H_2 abundance and  velocity distribution in nearby diffuse clouds in the Chamaeleon complex.The selected lines of sight present a wide variety in infrared colors,  E(B-V), Rv and molecular abundances so that we can check the dependence of  H_2 properties with these characteristics.  After IRAS data revealed spatial variations in the dust emission color of these clouds, these  variations have been correlated with changes in the shape of the UV part of  the extinction curve, showing that they are due to variations in the size  distribution of small dust particles.  Comparative studies in the  millimeter, visible and UV ranges have shown that highly energetic  processes are present in the cloud presenting mid-IR excess.Magnetohydrodynamic shocks and intermittent dissipation of turbulence have  been considered.  The proposed study of H_2 in these clouds will help  characterize these processes which should be of great significance for the  evolution of dust particles and of the gas itself.
Q103|1| | |Vidal-Madjar|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|An attempt will be made on the brightest EUVE source showing emission in  the 600 Angstrom EUVE band (410 c/ksec), to try to detect some second order  absorption signature corresponding to He I in the local ISM.
Q105|1| | |Deharveng|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale|We wish to observe a star-forming galaxy shortward of its (rest frame)  Lyman limit in order to measure or set limits on the Lyman continuum escape  fraction.  An object with a redshift large enough to get rid of residual  galactic gas absorption (lyman series) is selected.  Another related goal  is to use the spectrum longward of the Lyman limit for better understanding  the star, dust and gas content of the galaxy.
Q106|1| | |LeBrun|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale|We propose to make low resolution (R=2000 and S/N~20) observations of two  quasars, 3C 351 and Mark 205.  Their sightlines cross the near environment  of already known and identified galaxies or groups of galaxies, at impact  parameters in the range 40-700 kpc (H0 = 50 km/s/Mpc).  We will be able to  detect the O VI doublet lines in absorption down to a limiting equivalent  width of 0.2 Angstrom.  We thus plan to determine whether a highly ionized  phase exists in the close galactic environment in which the cooler and  denser MgII absorbers would be embedded.  These observations will also help  in determining whether collisional excitation is present in these clouds  and also to study the evolution of the shape and intensity of the  intergalactic UV flux at low redshift.
Q107|1| | |Ferlet|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|The star Sk 143 in the SMC has most peculiar properties: its extinction curve in the far-UV is of Galactic type, contrary to all the other SMC stars which have a small or absent extinction bump and a very strong rise in the extinction at shorter wavelength. It also has an apparently Galactic ratio of E(B-V) to atomic hydrogen column density. Still, the interstellar lines are at the SMC velocity, and suggest that the extinction is due to a molecular cloud in the SMC.  However a deep integration in the CO(1-0) line with the Swedish-ESO submillimeter telescope has given a null result. FUSE will help solve this mystery by observing the H_2 lines and other lines which might yield a detection of the absorbing gas.
Q108|1| | |Vidal-Madjar|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|Several investigations will be done simultaneously by observing the central  stars of some bright Planetary Nebulae (PN): (a)The wavelength range is particularly appropriate to study the continuum, the temperature and the wind of the PNe central stars; (b)In addition to the stellar continuum, the spectra will yield information concerning the nebula. The CIII line at 977A should be easily observable. Its intensity will be an additional independent measurement to resolve the controversy about the carbon abundance in PN; (c)FUSE will offer the possibility to detect molecular hydrogen lines in absorption against the stellar continuum. In several cases, the velocity separation of that component formed in the vicinity of the nebula and that formed in the general ISM will be possible. It should then be possible to determine how much additionnal H_2 is formed by shocks in the stellar winds. (d)Finally, the non detection of deuterium should allow a direct check of its evolution within stars since these PN were selected for their different 3He environment.
Q109|1| | |Vidal-Madjar|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|The standard post-AGB evolution theory predicts that throughout thewhole post-AGB phases the chemical surface composition of the star remains  essentially unchanged, because hydrogen shell burning ceases when the  surface H-rich layer has been thinned down to about 1.e-4 Msun.  However  about 25% of the spectroscopically observed post-AGB stars in the planetary  nebula stage are hydrogen-deficient and the origin of their peculiar  surface abundances is still unclear.  Among the hydrogen deficient post-AGB  stars the class of the PG1159 stars are the most peculiar.  They cover the  hottest part of the post-AGB evolution (65000 - 180000K) and their surface  is composed of carbon, helium, and oxygen (typically 50/30/20% by mass).Since mass loss could also be responsible for the observed peculiarities,  we need a determination of the mass-loss rate to be conclusive.  The O VI  line at 1034 Angstroms is best suited since it is the most sensitive  indicator for mass-loss in these stars.  In that frame we will observe  PG1159-035 the prototype as well as H1504+65 which is the most extreme one  of this class.  Deuterium evaluations will be also made on the line of  sights towards these stars.
Q110|1| | |Vidal-Madjar|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|Our purpose is to detect in the wing of Lyman Beta the signatures of  absorptions due to the quasimolecular satellites of H_2+ and H_2 in,  respectively, photospheric spectra of a white dwarf and a Lambda Boo star  where they have been observed in wing of Lyman Alpha.  These targets are  suitable for such detection: the white dwarf WD1620-391 has a pure hydrogen  atmosphere and that of HD125162 is depleted in metals.
Q111|1| | |Ferlet|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|The profiles of the absorption and emission lines, particularly of the O VI  doublet for the symbiotic binary AG Peg, will enable information to be  obtained on the kinematics of the regions of line formation.  The very high  ionization O VI doublet may in particular be produced very near the compact  hot component.  A wind from the cool component of the binary should be  present; signs of the continuing existence of a wind from the hot component  seen on older IUE spectra as well as a possible region where the winds  collide, will be looked for.
Q112|1| | |Ferlet|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|We propose to observe the highly mass-accreting cataclysmic binary IX Vel  in the far UV, for the first time at a very high spectral resolution  (R~30000), to infer the physics of the accretion very close to the white  dwarf.  A detailed analysis of the absorption resonance lines of O VI, PV  and SVI by means of phase-resolved spectra (exposure time of 1/8 Porbital)  will bring important clues to probe the structure of the wind (geometry,  velocity law, inhomogeneities).  When combined with the study of the  continuum distribution in the far UV, this will allow us to test the still  unknown mechanism of wind formation and to distinguish between different  proposed models for the boundary layer which plays a major role in the  dynamical evolution of these systems.
Q113|1| | |Ferlet|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|The absorption and emission line profiles of the old nova V603 Aql will  be observed with FUSE in order to further study the properties of what  appear to be an accretion disk and wind coming from this disk, also studied  at longer wavelengths.  Rapid line profile variations already seen for  other lines in HST spectra, will in be searched for and examined, this  being the case in particular for the O VI doublet.
Q114|1| | |Ferlet|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|The study of high excitation line transitions in the wavelength range  observed by FUSE will bring important information on the nature of  activities taking place in the outermost layers of Be stars.  The Lyman  energy distribution predicted by thermal models of stellar atmospheres,  which does not even agree with observations of normal B stars, will  probably produce larger disagreements in Be stars, where, as highly  rotating objects, the atmospheric structure remains quite unknown.  A young  B star in a binary system with a T-Tauri star will also be observed for the  purpose of comparison.  This program is also conducted in the frame of  other observing programs toward B and Be stars.
Q119|1| | |Deleuil| |The purpose of this program is to give new insights on the signatures of  circumstellar gas around main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars.  For  the stars Beta Pic (HD39060) and 51 Oph (HD158643), the gas already  detected may be the by-product of some activity (like evaporation and/or  collision of kilometer-sized bodies) in a young planetary system in its  clearing out phase.  These observations are expected to allow the  identification of the main form of the gaseous phase (H_2, CO, OI, NI, CII  ?) and to give information on the ionization equilibrium of the zero radial  velocity as well as accreting gas.  Analysis of multiplet ratios will allow  to probe the sizes of the inflowing gas structures.
Q201|2| |Cecile|Gry|Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille and ISO Data Center|We propose to study the H2 excitation, as well as the H2 abundance and  velocity distribution in nearby diffuse clouds. This is to complement the study started with Q101 for clouds in  the Chamaeleon complex. The selected lines of sight present a wide variety in infrared colors,  E(B-V), Rv and molecular abundances so that we can check for correlations between these characteristics and H2 properties. After IRAS data have evidenced spatial variations in the dust emission  color of these clouds, these variations have been correlated with changes  in the shape of the UV part of the extinction curve, showing that they are  due to variations in the size distribution of small dust particles. Comparative studies in the millimeter, visible and UV ranges have shown  that highly energetic processes are present in the cloud presenting mid-IR  excess. Magnetohydrodynamic shocks and intermittent dissipation of turbulence  have been considered. The proposed study of H2 in these clouds will help  characterize these processes which should be of great significance for the evolution of dust particles and of the gas itself.
Q206|2| |Vincent|Le Brun|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale|This program is the continuation of the Q106 program on the study of the  OVI phase in galactic halos. We have selected a third quasar, Q0026+1259  (Bowen & Blades, 1997). Two galaxies lie close to the quasar sightline,  which could give rise to OVI absorption lines, which FUSE only would be  able to detect. The quasars has a flux of 2x10^-14 erg/s/cm^2/A.
Q210|2| |Guillaume|Hebrard|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|Quasi-molecular satellites provide an important source of opacity in the DA white dwarf atmospheres not only in the red wing of Lyman alpha, but also in the red wing of Lyman beta.  The recently discovered line satellites in the red wing of Lyman beta due to the close collisions of atomic hydrogen with protons fall right on the range of maximum sensitivity of FUSE (1050 - 1100 A). This spectrum region has a great potential for determining basic stellar parameters, provided that the physics underlying its formation is well described. This is exactly what we are able to achieve.  We propose to observe one DA  cool white dwarf in order to study the temperature sensitivity of the Lyman beta spectrum and deduce the lower limit of appearence of these line satellites.
Q219|2| |Martial|Andre|CNES, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|The purpose of this program is to obtain spectra of a new target for the circumstellar disk program (P119, Q119) which aims to observe the signatures of circumstellar gas around main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars. The selected target HD 163296 is a well known active HAeBe star. It is  surrounded by a circumstellar dust and gas. Episode of accretion and outflows have been discovered with HST.A remnant H2 similar to the one detected with FUSE toward AB Aur  (Roberge et al. 2001) could be observed. In any case, the comparison with AB Aur will be very fruitful.
Q221|2| |Martial|Andre|The John Hopkins University|The Red Rectangle is a remarkable bipolar nebula associated with the star HD 44179. First studied by Cohen et al (1975), the nature of this nebula is still not well understood. High-resolution infrared imaging Mekarnia et al (1998) showed that the nebula is produced by a compact equatorial disk of dust. Far ultraviolet observation of this nebula may be an enormous benefit to the study of evolving disk systems, leading to the best source information along with previous spectroscopic studies.
Q222|2| |Magali|Deleuil,|Laboratoire Astrophysique de Marseille|We propose to observe the central region of the nearby spiral galaxy M100  in order to properly measure the column density of the molecular  hydrogen gas via its absorption lines  (Lyman and Werner bands). CO (J=1-0)  data are available for this galaxy as well as metallicity measurments  within the same aperture as that of FUSE.  Therefore we will be able to perform a direct measure of the CO to H2  conversion factor in a normal spiral galaxy.
Q223|2| |Roger|Ferlet|CNRS, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|Mkn36 is known to be a blue compact galaxy presenting a relatively  low metallicity. The purpose of this investigation is to search for  H_2 in the context of an intermediate metallicity object.These observations should also give access to a more precise  evaluation of the elements abundances within such a galaxy as well  as the physical state of the absorbing gas. If the stellar component responsible for the UV light is well placed behind absorbing material presenting a small enough spread of the velocity distribution including thermal, turbulent and large motion broadening, then possibly an estimation of the deuterium abundance in such a low metallicity object could be attempted.  In such a case possible follow up observationbs will have to be considered.

Q225|2| |Alfred|Vidal-Madjar|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|NGC 5102 is a very atypical giant lenticular galaxy: (1) its ultraviolet  emission is much stronger than in other early-type galaxies observed by  the IUE satellite; (2) it is a gas-rich galaxy where HII regions have been  detected; (3) individual observations of blue stars near the center of the  galaxy with  the  FOC/HST suggest they are young massive stars (Deharveng et  al. 1997). All these results are evidences of a recent star-forming event. As shown by HUT observations of other early-type galaxies (Brown et al. 1995),  NGC 5102 should also have a population of hot old stars (post-AGB, hot  horizontal branch, AGB manque stars) contributing to the ultraviolet emission. Between 900 and 1200 A, the spectrum is very sensitive to the temperature of  the hottest stars: FUSE data should therefore be especially efficient to  disentangle the young hot stellar populations from older ones.  To this purpose, the spectral  energy distribution will also be connected to  IUE data and optical and near-infrared colors. The global spectrum (continuum and stellar lines) will finally be analyzed  with our evolutionary synthesis model PEGASE (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997,  2000) in terms of star formation history and metallicity. Modeling the spectral energy distribution of NGC 5102 is essential to  understand both the star-forming process in ellipticals and S0's and to  analyze observations of such galaxies at high redshift, when they underwent  star formation. This will put important constraints on cosmological models of  galaxy formation.
Q301|3| | |Vidal-Madjar|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|We will search for extra-solar planet aurorae emission (HI, H2) in the spectrum of stars with known extra-solar planets. The selected targets harbor "hot Jupiter" type planets or/and multiple systems. The observations will be performed during the quadrature to optimize the chance of detection using the velocity Doppler shift of the planets.
Q303|3| | |Gry|Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille and ISO Data Center|WR140 is going through periastron passage of its 7.94-year eccentric orbit in February 2001. X-ray monitoring with RXTE has shown that the heavy X-ray absorption expected as the Wolf-Rayet star moves into the line-of-sight to the O-star primary  has started.  Previous IUE observations have shown considerable extra absorption in P Cygni profiles was seen even  months later. Nearer periastron these absorbtion effects should be much more pronounced. Although the interstellar absorbtion is quite high to WR140, the region longward of 1100 A has several lines of interest that should show heavy absorption through the WR wind. The object will be observed once duringthe periastron passage and once several months later to evidence the  variations.
Q304|3| | |Gry|Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille and ISO Data Center|Hen 3-1357 (known as the 'Stingray Nebula') is the youngest Planetary Nebula  known in the sky. It has become ionized within the past few decades and its  central star seems to be still rapidly evolving in the H-R diagram towards hotter effective temperatures. With this proposal we want to determine the current effective temperature of the central star and the characteristics of the stellar wind thirteen years after its discovery with IUE.  This will enable us to determine whether the rapid spectral changes observed in the last few years are the consequence of an  episodic post-AGB mass loss event or the result of a continuous  evolution in the H-R digram. In any of these cases, the observations will help us to understand this short and, thus, still poorly known transition phase which leads to the formation of a new PN.
Q305|3| | |Deharveng|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale|There is an on-going effort to measure the Lyman continuum radiation  escaping from galaxies. Current data suggest a cosmic evolution of the escape fraction with implications on the contribution of star  formation to the ionisation of the intergalactic medium. Measurements of nearby galaxies with FUSE should confirm the trend observed.
Q306|3| | |Lecavelier|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|We will search for H2 absorption lines in the spectrum of stars surrounding by circumstellar disks in which H2 is already detected through quadrupole  rotational transitions.  By observing different inclination of disks, these observations will constrain  the spatial distribution of the molecular gas. This should help to solve the  issues raised by the observations of H2 in the Beta Pictoris disk.
Q307|0| |Dr. Magali A.-M|Deleuil|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale|The challenge of this program is to detect the UV atmospheric signatures of HD209458b in absorption on the expected emission lines of the star during a planetary transit, or in emission. The detection of such a spectrum would provide important diagnostics on the composition and physical state of the planetary atmosphere. This would have a great impact on the atmospheric models of extrasolar planets -- as observationnal constraint are critically missing -- and will bring new insight to the formation scenario of such ''hot'' giant planet.
Q319|3| | |Deleuil|Laboratoire d'Astronomie Spatiale|The purpose of this program is to obtain spectra of new targets for the circumstellar disk program (P119, Q119, P219, Q219) which aims to observe  the signatures of circumstellar gas around main-sequence and pre-main-sequence stars. HD 141569 is a well-known pre-main sequence stars surrounded by a  circumstellar disk for which images have been obtained, given information on the dust distribution and inclination of the disk. HD 36112 is a young pre-main sequence star surrounding by a huge amount of CO. The derivation of the CO/H2 ration will give important information on the  gaseous content as well as on the origin and history of disk around stars more  massive than the Sun.
S101|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|The purpose of this test is to measure the size and location of the LWRS, MDRS, and HIRS apertures. It will also serve to measure the magnitude of the worm in the 3 apertures.
S202|0| |Dr. David|Sahnow|FUSE|During background observations, change the detector pulse height thresholds in order to characterize both the upper and lower charge threshold settings. This data will be used to help minimize detector background when observing faint objects.
S304|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|This activity will measure the one dimensional line spread function (LSF) of FUSE data, and determine the shape and variation with wavelength.
S307|0| |Dr. William|Oegerle|FUSE|Science Verification activity S307 is designed to provide information about the signal-to-noise capabilities of the FUSE instrument as determined from the observation and analysis of astronomical absorption line data. It does not address S/N for emission line observations. Understanding the S/N limitations of FUSE data in the high S/N limit will provide a key determination of how weak absorption lines can be and still be observable. The FUSE bandpass contains many weak metal and molecular lines useful for determining stellar/interstellar abundances and physical conditions.
S312|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|It is desirable to observe stars with narrow emission lines both to establish an absolute wavelength scale and to measure spectral resolution. In this program we will carefully take a short exposure of an emission line object. Special care must be taken because the two OVI emission lines are very bright, and their intrinsic line widths are not well established. Therefore, the local count rates could be very high and exceed the formal limit. This test will establish how bright they are. Only detector 2 will be used for this observation.
S404|0| |Mr. Steve|Conard|FUSE|Starting from the current thermal conditions, load a new thermal table which has cooler GMA temperatures for gratings LiF 2 and SiC 2. Immediately start an exposure of airglow only. Take continuous (or nearly so) exposures for a period of approximately 3 orbits. At that point, reload the original thermal table. Allow time for gratings to achieve thermalization prior to taking any science data. Using the airglow Ly beta line, determine the orbital " spectral" motion seen during the test.
S405|0| | |Blair|FUSE Observatory Program|This program is used to obtain background data during times that would otherwise go to waste.  These are primarily periods when a large change in beta angle or pole angle has been made and we must thermalize prior to performing a channel alignment. The alignment target is placed at the FES reference point and the LWRS aperture is located on a nearby patch of sky.  Occasionally, other long background observations have been made under this program ID (for ance, when we were just coming back on-line after the reaction wheel problem and were not ready for normal operations yet).  User beware, because the LWRS aperture will occasionally have a faint source, but most of these observations are just sky background observations.
S505|0| |Prof. William P|Blair|FUSE|This program will be used to denote background measurements obtained during alignment thermalization periods. Since a fairly well-defined set of objects are now available for M112 alignment activities, and these targets are visited periodically, over time we should be able to build up substantial background integrations in these directions. This program basically makes use of time that would otherwise be wasted. By using an S program ID, the intent is that these data will be publically available immediately upon ingest to the archive, but that the observing time will not be charged against either PI team or Guest Investigator time allocations. This program is a continuation of S405.
S513|0| |Dr. William|Blair|FUSE|This program is designed to test the idea of multiple PKUPs per viewing interval using the MDRS aperture. The same target will be scheduled in several different patterns with respect to the orbital Day/Night boundary to assess the best method of MDRS operations to get SiC coverage of D/H and other targets.
S514|0| |Dr. William|Blair|FUSE|The purpose of this test is severalfold, all relating to the use of various observing strategies with different apertures and how they affect the resulting data quality. We will compare LWRS data taken with and without XOFFsets (e.g. dithering). We will attempt observations with the HIRS aperture, concentrating on LiF1, to see if significant gains in resolution can be made. Finally, additional testing of the MDRS-multiple PKUP per orbit strategy will be performed. It is expected that all of these tests will be performed on the same target in sequence, to minimize the variables and maximize information learned about the different techniques. Multiple runs of this test are anticipated with differing strategies for the detailed sequence of activities.
S516|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|This is a test of our ability to move the MDRS predictively to keep light in all four channels for a CVZ target. Rather than multiple peak-ups during a single orbit, only one will be done, and relative FPA motions done based on data from S513 and S514 (as well as other peak-up tests). For this test, only the SiC channels will be moved. Exposures will be time-tag, and examined for changes in count rates. The three orbits of predictive motions will be bracketed by orbits of =93peak-ups around the orbit=94 in order to better understand the data obtained.
S517|0| |Dr. Harold|Weaver|FUSE|This proposal is being used to test two different techniques for tracking Moving Targets (MTs): for 3 orbits we will use GSs for controlling the tracking and for 3 other orbits we will do " coincident" tracking on another MT in the field. The goal is to place Saturn's satellite Titan in the center of the LWRS in both cases. For the coincident tracking mode, we will track on the Saturnian satellite Iapetus (V~11.5), as the displacement relative to Titan is less than a few arcsec over 3 orbits.
S520|0| |Dr. Scott|Friedman|FUSE|This test will consist of defocussing only the LiF2 mirror, and taking a HIRS fp-split observation. Then LiF2 is returned to the nominal focus position, and an M112 is done to re-align the channels.
S521|0| |Dr. B-G|Andersson|FUSE|This will test the technique of observing stars that are very bright in the FUV by placing them off the slit and measurig the instrumentally scattered light.
S522|0| |Dr. B-G|Andersson|FUSE|This program is aimed at measuring the scattering function of FUSE at offset distances less than 30" . This is done by observing a bright (but less than the brightlimit) target after X-axis SAMA offsets from the target. We ask for three offsets, 20" , 10" and 5" from the center of the MDRS slit.
S523|0| |Dr. David|Sahnow|FUSE|The purpose of this observation is to test the procedures for observing a bright object by defocusing the SiC mirrors.
S525|0| |Dr. David|Sahnow|FUSE|This observation will collect data on a previously observed object with the detector high voltage values at lower than nominal values. This technique may be used to observe very bright objects in the future. 
S601|0| |Scott|Friedman|FUSE Observatory Program|Since restarting Science Operations in late January 2002, and while we were especially limited in sky availablity for operations,  we have occasionally found it necessary to observe previous FUSE targets either for testing or to fill out a section of timeline.  These observations have been done under the S601 program ID. Usually this is additional time on faint targets for which improved S/N would be (potentially) beneficial.  As the high declination target pool is increased, we should find the need to do this ramp down, but occasional new observations may occur under this program ID from time to time.

X005|0| |Dr. William P.|Blair|Johns Hopkins University|We propose to observe a supernova remnant filament selected primarily on the basis of its bright X-ray emission, to search for faint, previously undetected emission lines arising from the hot gas. The observation will use the LWRS aperture and will not require high quality pointing accuracy or high spectral resolution. The observation will provide new insight into the physics of the shock wave-ISM interaction mechanism while demonstrating FUSE's sensitivity to diffuse emission. Our primary target is a position on the eastern side of the Cygnus Loop, southeast of the position known as XA. 
X006|0| |Dr. Paul D.|Feldman|The Johns Hopkins University|This program consists of separate observations of two components of the Jovian magnetospheric system, the Jovian north polar aurora and the Io plasma torus. For the aurora, the goal is to observe the H2 bands at high spectral resolution to determine both the rotational and kinetic temperatures of H2 and the absorption below 1108 A. From this self-absorption, we can derive the H2 column densities above the level of deposition of the energy of the precipitating particles so as to determine also the penetration depth of these particles and thus their energy. The analysis of the H2 Rydberg lines (below 1200 A) and the H Lyman series would refine the auroral diagnostic regarding the identity (still unknown) and the penetration level of the magnetospheric particles that precipitate into the upper atmosphere. Correlated observations with HST/STIS will provide complete spectral coverage of the H2 Lyman and Werner bands systems from 900 to 1650 A. Our second objective is to search for minor constituents in the Io torus plasma which consists primarily of sulfur and oxygen with a sprinkling of sodium. There is good reason to expect that other species may be present, for instance carbon may be produced by sputtering off the other moons. Argon may be present due to the radioactive decay of potassium in the body of the moons. These and other elements have strong lines in the FUSE range. FUSE observations of the torus will provide a sensitivity which is a thousandfold below the strong lines of the dominant species, ionic sulfur and oxygen. The large FUSE aperture provides an ideal capability for this study because of the large angular extent of the LWRS aperture and the high dispersion which separates the lines from other contaminating features. In addition, correlated observations with HST/STIS will provide an enhanced ability to compare the spectroscopically derived ion temperature with that deduced from in situ Galileo measurements.
X014|0| |Dr. George|Sonneborn|NASA/GSFC|Planetary nebulae are important agents of enrichment of the ISM. Together with mass loss from red giant stars, they represent the process by which intermediate mass stars eject appreciable amounts of processed, chemically enriched material. The deep convective envelopes of these stars (PN progenitors) should cycle material to a temperature regime where deuterium should be easily destroyed (yielding 3He). Thus an important test of this process is to attempt to detect deuterium in the neutral envelopes of planetary nebulae. The second objective of this program will be to detect the presence of H2 in a planetary nebula. It is not known if any H2 present in the atmosphere of the PN progenitor survives the ejection process. H2 might form either in the cool stellar wind of the progenitor or in the cool, neutral envelope of the PN itself. These two objectives can be met with FUSE spectra of the central stars of selected PN. These stars are extremely hot and provide a good FUV spectrum for absorption spectroscopy of the neutral envelope. The central stars are also very interesting in their own right, being the hot evolved cores of intermediate mass stars. 
X015|0| |Dr. Don|York|University of Chicago|It is proposed to perform a FUSE Early Release Observation (ERO) to study the ISM in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using the star Sk108. This star is the second brightest UV target in the SMC. Extensive modeling has been done using interstellar lines observed with HST. The sight line is known to have at least 25 interstellar components spread over 230 kms^-1. Using the HST modeling, we can deconvolve the components into natural groups for which average group abundances are available from the HST data. Four preliminary investigations will be made: 1) an augmentation of the abundance studies done previously, in particular the addition of the elements N, O, Ar, P and Al; 2) determination of the gas temperature and of the radiation temperature of molecular hydrogen; 3) determination of the presence of O VI, N II, N III, S III, S IV, P III, P V, and Fe III; and 4) exploration of the excitation and ionization level of the H II regions in the gas of the SMC. A companion proposal for an ERO on an LMC star, HD36402, is being submitted in parallel with this proposal. While the above studies are of interest in their own right, the comparison of the noted quantities between the SMC, LMC and the Galactic gas clouds could lead to new insights into the nature of interstellar grains, the radiation field in the respective galaxies, and the formation of molecular hydrogen.
X017|0| |Dr. Kenneth|Sembach|Johns Hopkins University|We propose a long FUSE Early Release Observation of an extragalactic sight line to study the O VI absorption along a complete path through the Galactic halo. The best object for such a study is Mrk 509. The sight line contains highly ionized disk and halo gas previously observed in Si IV, C IV, and N V, as well as a pair of highly ionized high velocity clouds that may be located in the Local Group, and two Lyman-alpha absorbers near the redshift of Mrk 509 itself. In addition to ISM/IGM science, the proposed observation would also be useful for studies of the ionization within the Seyfert nucleus. The proposed integration of 54 ksec requires no special acquisition or observing strategies. The resulting science should yield several ERO papers, even if instrument performance is not optimized by the time of the ERO. Besides producing exciting science results, this ERO will showcase the ability of FUSE to observe extragalactic objects at high spectral resolution.
X018|0| |Dr Paul A.|Crowther|University College London|Oxygen sequence Wolf-Rayet stars (WO-type) represent the final, brief phase in the evolution of the most massive stars prior to a SN explosion. Their properties are truly extreme - temperatures are in excess of 100,000K, mass-loss rates typically one solar mass per 100,000 years, with the fastest winds of any `normal' star (approx 4,500 km/s!). However, of the known 300+ WR stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, only five are of WO-type, characterised by extremely broad high excitation oxygen and carbon emission lines in their UV and optical spectra, with mammoth OVI 3811-34A emission, reaching 10 times the local continuum. Of these, solely Sanduleak 2 (= Brey 93) in the LMC is lightly reddened and single. FUSE observations will reveal a strong OVI 1032-1038A P Cygni profile, plus weaker oxygen, carbon and sulphur features. We will carry out a quantitative analysis of Sand 2 (WO3) to help address the exact evolutionary status of WO stars. FUSE data - specifically OVI (1032-1038, 1123), CIV (948, 1108) OIV (922) and SVI (939) will be combined with UV HST/FOS and optical ground-based observations plus state-of-the-art model atmosphere synthesis to allow improved atmospheric elemental abundances (He, C, O), mass-loss rate and wind velocity determinations.
X020|0| |Dr. John|Hutchings|Dominion Astrophysical Observatory|We propose to observe two O7 stars of comparable luminosity in the SMC and LMC. These observations will provide the first high-resolution spectra that cover the wide range of stellar wind diagnostics that lie in the FUSE wavelength range. This will allow a complete mass-loss model that incorporates the ionization balance and abundances of the elements that drive the winds. The data will enable a direct comparison of these effects in local galaxies with modest (LMC) and substantially (SMC) lower abundances than our Galaxy. In addition, higher ionization states like O VI will be observed with high spectral resolution for the first time. However, the main science driver is the wealth of new lines available for study, which will enable significant new wind models to be developed in a short time. Differential comparison between the SMC/LMC stars, and with similar targets in the Galaxy (probable SV or ERO targets too), will provide added interest with cosmological significance. These observations will illustrate the power of FUSE for hot star studies by providing an initial comparison of spectra for objects in different galactic environments. The same targets will also be of interest for ISM studies, although the proposed exposures will not produce optimum S/N for the resolution required for narrow interstellar lines. The spectra will also enable the UV extinction curves below Ly alpha to be compared between galaxies. The UV extinction is known to differ significantly at IUE and HST wavelengths, presumably due to the different composition and grain size in the different ISM. 
X021|0| |Prof. Theodore|Snow|University of Colorado|The star lambda Cephei (HD 210839) will be observed during the ERO phase, to demonstrate the capabilities of FUSE for the observation and analysis of molecular hydrogen bands in the far ultraviolet. The only existing H2 data on this line of sight, from Copernicus, are of marginal data quality, but for FUSE this target is bright enough to yield optimal data quality, and will help to demonstrate FUSE's limits in S/N and spectral resolution, as well as its utility as a probe of interstellar H2. The target star, an O6Ia supergiant, will also display strong stellar wind features and will help illustrate the importance of FUSE for the obsrevation and analysis of stellar outflows in hot stars.
X024|0| |Dr John|Hutchings|NRC of Canada|Eta Carinae is a famous hot variable star that is surrounded by a complex nebula ejected about 150 years ago. The central star is undergoing rapid evolutionary changes that have been of continuing interest, particularly in the UV, where the spectrum is rich and complex. In recent months, there have been changes of a factor 2 or more in the central star, and this is leading to changes in the nebular spectrum and ionisation. The FUSE range opens up a major new set of lines of diagnostic interest. As the UV flux arises in the ~15" nebula as well as the central star, it would add to the science to observe it through more than one FUSE aperture. HD5980 is a hot variable star in the SMC. It is considered to be a double W-R binary with a period of 19 days. It has exhibited LBV behaviour over the past decade, with changes in the ionisation and profiles of many line features. The FUSE range will cover the richest set of lines to reveal the complex wind in this system, and provide a unique laboratory for studying this extremely active stage of massive star evolution. 
X025|0| |Prof. Jeffrey|Linsky|University of Colorado|The A7 V star Altair (= HD 187642) occupies a unique position in the HR Diagram as the hottest star with late-type star characteristics. IUE, Einstein, and ROSAT observations show that Altair has ultraviolet emission lines and X-ray emission indicative of chromospheric and coronal plasma heated either by shock waves or magnetic reconnection events similar to the active late-type stars. Stars slightly hotter than Altair do not show these phenomena, apparently due to shallower convective zones. FUSE can obtain a rich FUV emission line spectrum that will likely contain C III, O VI, and the hydrogen Lyman emission lines. A FUSE spectrum of Altair will enable us to determine whether or not the relative heating rates for the 10^4, 10^5, and >10^6 K plasma follow the trends seen in the cooler stars, whether the heating is acoustic or magnetic in character, and whether the emission line shapes and Doppler shifts indicate a wind or interesting dynamics. A 5 ks exposure should obtain S/N in the range 16 to 33 per 0.032 A resolution element for the important emission lines.

Z001|0| |Prof. Steven N.|Shore|Indiana University South Bend|We propose to obtain FUSE LWRS spectra of the ONeMg nova LMC 2000 during Dec. 2000, contemporaneously with scheduled STIS observations in late Nov. The first STIS medium resolution observations show that the nova is virtually a clone of V382 Vel (N Vel 1999), an ONeMg nova that was observed at 3 epochs with HST and two epochs with FUSE in Cycle 1. FUSE observations at this relatively early epoch are fundamental for understanding the energetics and dynamics of a nova outburst, when a substantial portion of the flux is emerging in the FUSE window, but in the case of this particular nova the need is more acute. The fact that this object is so close in morphology, dynamics, and line strength to a galactic nova (and one for which we have FUSE spectra) means we will be able to complete the determination of the bolometric luminosity of both novae and with these and V1974 Cyg, likely the calibration of this entire subclass of novae. There are already striking similarities between the V382 Vel development and V1974 Cyg. In fact, we used the latter to predict observations of the more recent outburst. Continuing this bootstrapping, we used V382 Vel successfully for predictions of LMC 2000. This argues the physical similarities among novae in this class in spite of rather differing metallicities of the host galaxies.

Z003|0| |Dr. Knox|Long|Space Telescope Science Institute|WZ Sge is the prototype (and the only moderately well-studied) example of a group of very short period dwarf novae which have extremely long interoutburst periods. This is a proposal to observe the first outburst of this system in more than 20 years. Though such systems may in fact be dominate in numerical terms the entire population of cataclysmic variables, this will be the first such system to have been observed in the FUSE wavelength range. We will use the observations is to characterize the accretion disk and wind of this very compact, nearly edge-on system. We will contrast the nature of this disk to that of more " normal" dwarf novae that have been observed with FUSE. This will be accomplished through modelling of the integrated FUSE spectrum, and by studying temporal variations in the system on orbital and shorter timescales. The observations will serve as a benchmark for possible studies of the evolution of the disk during late stages of the outburst.
Z004|0| |Dr. Barry|Welsh|EUREKA Scientific|We shall probe the lower halo-Local Bubble interaction region to search for signs of the infall or outflow of neutral and/or ionized interstellar gas caused by a by a galactic fountain. By using hot white dwarf targets of known, increasing distance away from the galactic plane up to 0.3kpc that are located in a very low neutral density line-of-sight called the Local Interstellar Chimney, we shall be able to accurately determine the kinetic temperature, electron density, element abundance/depletions and gross velocity structure of the gas in the Local Bubble as a function of increasing height above the galactic disk as it merges into the inner galactic halo.

Z006|0| |Dr. Knox S.|Long|Space Telescope Science Institute|AM Herculis, the brightest strongly magnetic cataclysmic variable, entered in December 2001 an extended state of low accretion activity. During such low states, the magnetic white dwarf totally dominates the ultraviolet emission of the system, and only then an in-depth study of its photospheric properties becomes feasible. We propose to obtain an exploratory FUSE observation of the magnetic white dwarf in AM Herculis. We will use these data to measure the Zeeman splittings of metal (C, N, O, Si) resonance lines in a magnetic field that is far beyond the reach of any terrestrial laboratory (B=14MG). These observations will provide fundamental experimental input that should enable significant progress of our understanding of the behavior of matter in strong magnetic fields.
Z007|9| | |Sembach|STScI|The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, to be installed in the Hubble Space Telescope, has a nominal wavelength range of 1170-3200 A; however, in its low-dispersion (R ~ 2500) mode, the instrument may well provide wavelength coverage down to the Lyman limit.  The HST+COS sensitivity at wavelengths between 900 and 1200 A is unknown and will remain so until the instrument is on-orbit.  We would like to use FUSE to observe two COS flux standards (both white dwarf stars) for comparison with on-orbit data obtained with COS.

Z009|0| |Dr. Nancy|Brickhouse|Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory|FUSE observations of the eclipsing contact binary VW Cep (HD 197433) will provide diagnostics of transition region structure under the extreme conditions of rapid rotation. Optical Doppler images of VW Cep have recently provided the first evidence on a contact binary for large polar spots, similar to polar spots observed on the less rapidly rotating RS CVn systems, but in stark contrast to the Sun's polar ``coronal holes.'' We propose to exploit the unique spectral resolution and time-tagged data capability of FUSE to study Doppler shifted and rotationally broadened line profiles as a function of the orbital phase of the system. Emission line diagnostics for emission measure, density, and abundances will complement the velocity measurements.
